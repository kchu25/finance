# Reading a Corporate Balance Sheet

Hey! A balance sheet is basically a financial snapshot of what a company owns and owes at a specific moment in time. Think of it as a company's net worth statement.

## The Golden Equation

Everything revolves around this:

$$\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}$$

The sheet always balances (hence the name!). What the company owns equals what it owes to others plus what it owes to shareholders.

> **What to Look at First?**
> 
> Honestly, start with **cash and debt**. How much actual cash does the company have? Then look at how much debt it's carrying. This tells you if the company can survive a rough patch.
> 
> Next, check the **current ratio** - just divide current assets by current liabilities. Above 1.0 means they can cover their short-term bills. Below 1.0? They might struggle.
> 
> Finally, peek at **equity**. Is it growing over time? That's a good sign. Shrinking? The company might be losing money or paying out too much to shareholders.
> 
> Don't get lost in every line item at first. These three things—cash position, ability to pay bills, and whether equity is healthy—tell you most of what you need to know about financial health.

> > **Finding them:** Public companies must file reports with the SEC. Look for **10-Q** (quarterly) or **10-K** (annual) reports on SEC.gov, the company's investor relations page, or sites like Yahoo Finance. Private companies don't publish these publicly.

> > - **Balance sheet** = Financial health snapshot (what you own/owe right now)
> > - **Income statement** = Profitability over time (are you making money?)
> > - **Cash flow statement** = Actual cash movements (where's the money going?)

## The Three Main Sections

### 1. Assets (What the Company Owns)

Assets are listed from most liquid (easily converted to cash) to least liquid:

**Current Assets** - stuff that'll become cash within a year:
- Cash and cash equivalents
- Accounts receivable (money customers owe you)
- Inventory
- Prepaid expenses

**Non-Current Assets** - longer-term stuff:
- Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)
- Intangible assets (patents, trademarks, goodwill)
- Long-term investments

### 2. Liabilities (What the Company Owes)

Also organized by timing:

**Current Liabilities** - due within a year:
- Accounts payable (money you owe suppliers)
- Short-term debt
- Accrued expenses (wages, taxes)

**Non-Current Liabilities** - due after a year:
- Long-term debt
- Pension obligations
- Deferred tax liabilities

### 3. Shareholders' Equity (What's Left Over)

This is the owners' claim after all debts are paid:
- Common stock (money from selling shares)
- Retained earnings (profits kept in the business)
- Additional paid-in capital

## Quick Reading Tips

**Check the liquidity**: Can the company pay its bills? Look at current assets vs. current liabilities.

**Look at the debt levels**: Too much in liabilities compared to equity might mean the company is risky.

**Compare over time**: One balance sheet is a snapshot, but comparing several quarters or years shows trends.

**The equation always works**: If assets are \$1M and liabilities are \$600K, equity must be \$400K. That's how it stays balanced!

The balance sheet works alongside the income statement (showing profits over time) and cash flow statement (tracking actual cash movements) to give you the full financial picture.

## Common Ways to Evaluate a Company

Once you've got the balance sheet basics down, here's what investors typically look at:

**Liquidity Ratios** - Can they pay their bills?
- **Current Ratio**: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities (want > 1.0)
- **Quick Ratio**: (Current Assets - Inventory) ÷ Current Liabilities (more conservative test)

**Leverage Ratios** - How much debt are they carrying?
- **Debt-to-Equity**: Total Debt ÷ Total Equity (lower is usually safer)
- **Debt-to-Assets**: Total Debt ÷ Total Assets (shows what % is financed by debt)

**Profitability** - Are they actually making money?
- **ROE (Return on Equity)**: Net Income ÷ Equity (how efficiently they use shareholder money)
- **ROA (Return on Assets)**: Net Income ÷ Total Assets (how well they use what they own)
- **Profit Margins**: From the income statement, but crucial context

**Growth Signals** - Is the business expanding?
- Compare balance sheets year-over-year: Are assets growing? Is equity increasing?
- Revenue growth (from income statement)
- Is cash flow positive and growing?

**Red Flags to Watch For**
- Debt growing faster than assets
- Cash declining while debt increases
- Negative equity (liabilities exceed assets!)
- Current ratio under 1.0 for extended periods

Remember: No single metric tells the whole story. A tech startup might have high debt but huge growth potential. A mature company might have modest growth but rock-solid financials. Context matters—compare companies within the same industry and look at trends over several years, not just one snapshot.

## Industry-Specific Focus: Computer Hardware Example

Different industries emphasize different metrics. Here's what matters in **computer hardware investing**:

**Inventory Management - Critical**

Hardware becomes obsolete fast, so:
- **Inventory turnover ratio**: How quickly they sell through stock (slow = write-downs)
- **Days inventory outstanding**: 90+ days is a red flag
- Compare inventory growth vs revenue growth—piling up inventory faster than sales? Trouble.

**Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**

Hardware needs factories and equipment:
- Are they investing enough to stay competitive?
- **CapEx as % of revenue** shows how capital-intensive the business is
- Is spending efficient or just burning cash?

**Working Capital Cycle**

Thin margins mean cash flow timing is everything:
- How long between paying suppliers and collecting from customers?
- **Cash conversion cycle**: Shorter is better
- Negative working capital (getting paid before paying suppliers) is ideal

**Gross Margins**

Hardware is commoditized:
- Margins typically 20-40% (vs software at 80%+)
- Watch quarter-over-quarter—shrinking margins signal pricing pressure
- Rising component costs can crush profitability

**Debt & Interest Coverage**

With tight margins:
- Can they service debt when margins compress?
- **Interest coverage ratio**: EBIT ÷ Interest Expense (want 3-5x minimum)

**Balance Sheet Red Flags in Hardware:**
- **Accounts Receivable** growing faster than revenue (customers not paying?)
- **Goodwill/Intangibles** from overpaying for acquisitions
- Weak **return reserves** (hardware has returns—are they accounting properly?)

**The Bottom Line:** Hardware = operational efficiency and cash management. Unlike software that scales easily, hardware companies live and die by inventory management, CapEx efficiency, and working capital. A company with mediocre products but excellent operations can outperform great products with bloated inventory and poor cash flow.
