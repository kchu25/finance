# Why Keeping Debt Feels Wrong But Is Right
## Five Mental Models That Make It Click

@@toc@@

## 1. The Problem

You borrow money. You buy an asset. The asset grows faster than the interest on the loan.

The math says: **keep the debt.** Don't repay.

Your brain screams: **PAY IT OFF.**

Every personal finance guru, every family member, every instinct you have says: *debt is bad,
get rid of it as fast as possible.* And yet the math — cold, relentless, correct — says the
opposite.

This post is about building the *intuition* so this stops feeling wrong. Not just understanding
the formula, but *feeling* it in your gut. Because until you feel it, you won't act on it — and
not acting on it costs you real money.

## 2. Mental Model 1: The Magic Seed

You find a magic seed. It doubles in value every year.

You also owe the seed shop \$100. They charge 5% interest.

The seed and the debt are both worth \$100 today. You could sell the seed, pay the debt, and walk
away clean. Debt-free. Zero stress. Dave Ramsey would be proud.

Or you could keep the seed.

| Year | Seed Value | Debt | Net Worth |
|:----:|:----------:|:----:|:---------:|
| 0 | \$100 | \$100 | \$0 |
| 1 | \$200 | \$105 | \$95 |
| 2 | \$400 | \$110 | \$290 |
| 3 | \$800 | \$116 | \$684 |
| 4 | \$1,600 | \$122 | \$1,478 |
| 5 | \$3,200 | \$128 | \$3,072 |

By year 5, the seed is worth \$3,200 and the debt is \$128. The debt is *noise*. You could flick
it away.

**If you had sold the seed on day 1 to pay off \$100 in debt, you gave up \$3,072.**

The lesson: **the seed's growth rate (100%) dwarfs the debt's growth rate (5%).** Selling the fast
grower to eliminate the slow grower is mathematically insane. It *feels* responsible. It *is*
destructive.

> But what if the seed doesn't double?

Then the analogy breaks. **This only works when the asset grows faster than the debt.** That's the
entire premise. If you don't believe your asset will outperform the borrow rate, repay immediately.
The question isn't whether debt is good or bad — it's whether your asset's return exceeds the cost
of carry.

## 3. Mental Model 2: The Employee

Your LINK position is an employee. Think of it that way.

This employee generates revenue for you: let's say 30% per year (your expected return on LINK).
On a \$1,000 position, that's \$300/yr in expected gains.

The employee has a salary: 5% per year (your borrow rate). That's \$50/yr.

**Profit per year: \$250.**

Now someone suggests you *fire* the employee to save the \$50/yr salary.

You'd never do that. No business owner would fire a profitable employee to save on payroll.
The employee earns 6× their salary. Firing them doesn't save you \$50 — it *costs* you \$250.

And yet that's exactly what "repay the debt" means. You're firing your most productive asset to
avoid a trivial carrying cost.

| Action | Revenue Lost | Cost Saved | Net Effect |
|:-------|:-----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Keep LINK + debt | \$0 | \$0 | +\$250/yr profit |
| Sell LINK, repay debt | −\$300/yr | +\$50/yr | **−\$250/yr** |

**Repaying the debt doesn't save you money. It costs you the spread.**

> *"But the employee might get sick!"*

Yes — the asset might crash. That's the risk. But you don't fire every employee because they
*might* get sick. You buy insurance (keep a liquidation buffer) and keep them working.

## 4. Mental Model 3: Two Bank Accounts

Imagine you have two bank accounts:

- **Account A** earns 30% per year (your LINK)
- **Account B** charges 5% per year (your debt)

Both start at \$1,000. You could transfer money from A to close B. Should you?

| Year | Account A (30%) | Account B (5%) | Gap |
|:----:|:---------------:|:--------------:|:---:|
| 1 | \$1,300 | \$1,050 | \$250 |
| 2 | \$1,690 | \$1,102 | \$588 |
| 3 | \$2,197 | \$1,158 | \$1,039 |
| 5 | \$3,713 | \$1,276 | \$2,437 |
| 10 | \$13,786 | \$1,629 | \$12,157 |

**The gap between A and B widens every year.** Every year you wait, closing A to pay off B
becomes a worse and worse deal. By year 10, you'd be emptying a \$13,786 account to pay off a
\$1,629 bill. It's absurd.

This is what makes it click for most people. You wouldn't drain a 30% savings account to pay off
a 5% loan. That's *obviously* wrong. And yet people do exactly this with their investments.

The reason it doesn't *feel* obvious is that Account A (your LINK) fluctuates wildly. Some months
it's up 50%, some months it's down 40%. Account B (your debt) just quietly ticks up at 5%,
steady and menacing. The volatility of A makes it feel unreliable. The steadiness of B makes it
feel urgent.

But over time — years, not months — A crushes B. The volatility is the price of admission. The
steady 5% is the distraction.

## 5. Mental Model 4: Renting Money

Reframe the debt entirely. You are not "in debt." You are **renting money.**

You rented \$6,000 from Aave. The rent is 5% per year = **\$300/yr = \$0.82/day.**

What did you do with that rented money? You bought LINK at \$8.80.

Now ask: **is \$0.82/day a good price for what you're getting?**

| If LINK reaches... | Your gain on rented money | Cost of rent (1yr) | Return on rent |
|:-------------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------:|:--------------:|
| \$12 | \$2,182 | \$300 | 7.3× |
| \$15 | \$4,227 | \$300 | 14.1× |
| \$20 | \$7,636 | \$300 | 25.5× |
| \$30 | \$14,455 | \$300 | 48.2× |
| \$50 | \$28,091 | \$300 | 93.6× |
| \$100 | \$62,182 | \$300 | 207.3× |

You're paying \$300/yr in rent for the *option* on tens of thousands in gains. This is the
cheapest rent you will ever pay in your life.

Would you cancel a \$300/yr Netflix subscription that had a chance of paying you \$62,000? Of
course not. **But that's what repaying the debt is.** You're canceling a \$300/yr subscription
to avoid the discomfort of owing.

### The rent reframe changes everything

When you think "I owe \$6,000," your brain goes into threat mode. Loss aversion kicks in.
You feel the weight.

When you think "I'm renting \$6,000 for \$0.82/day," your brain goes into cost-benefit mode.
You evaluate the deal. And the deal is *excellent*.

Same situation. Different frame. Completely different emotional response.

## 6. Mental Model 5: The Time Inversion

This one is the most powerful.

**Normal thinking:** "I owe \$6,000. I should pay it back as soon as possible."

**Correct thinking:** "I owe \$6,000. What will it cost me to pay it back *later*?"

If your asset appreciates, the cost of repaying *in real terms* drops every year:

| Year | LINK Price | Debt (5% APR) | LINK Needed to Repay | % of Stack |
|:----:|:----------:|:-------------:|:--------------------:|:----------:|
| 0 | \$8.80 | \$6,000 | 682 | 12.7% |
| 2 | \$12.67 | \$6,615 | 522 | 9.8% |
| 4 | \$18.25 | \$7,293 | 400 | 7.5% |
| 6 | \$26.28 | \$8,041 | 306 | 5.7% |
| 8 | \$37.84 | \$8,865 | 234 | 4.4% |
| 10 | \$54.49 | \$9,773 | 179 | 3.4% |

*Assuming 20% annual LINK growth.*

**Repaying today costs 682 LINK — 12.7% of your stack. Waiting 10 years costs 179 LINK — 3.4%.** 

The debt gets *cheaper* every year in real terms. Repaying now is paying the **maximum price**.
Every day you wait, the debt costs less to extinguish.

This is the time inversion: **urgency runs backwards.** The moment you feel most compelled to
repay (right now, when prices are low and the debt feels heavy) is the moment repaying is *most
expensive*. The moment repaying feels trivial (prices are high, debt is noise) is when you should
do it — but by then you won't need to.

### Why does this work?

Because debt is denominated in dollars, and dollars inflate. Your asset is denominated in itself
(LINK, stocks, real estate), and appreciating assets grow faster than inflation. The debt is
a fixed nominal amount chasing a moving target. It will never catch up.

This is the same mechanism that makes 30-year mortgages brilliant. Your grandparents' \$20,000
mortgage from 1970 is laughable today. The dollars they owed shrank. Their house didn't.

## 7. Why Your Brain Fights This

Even after reading five mental models, part of you still wants to pay off the debt. That's normal.
Here's why:

### 7.1 Loss Aversion (Kahneman & Tversky)

Losing \$100 hurts roughly 2× more than gaining \$100 feels good. The debt is a *loss* sitting on
your balance sheet. Your brain weighs it 2× heavier than the equivalent gain from your asset.
Even when the asset exceeds the debt, the debt *feels* worse than the asset feels good.

### 7.2 Certainty Bias

Paying off debt is a *guaranteed* return (you save 5% for sure). Holding the asset is an
*uncertain* return (maybe 30%, maybe −40%). Your brain overvalues the certain option even when
the expected value of the uncertain option is far higher. This is why people buy lottery tickets
in reverse — paying a premium for certainty.

### 7.3 Mental Accounting

You put "debt" and "investments" in separate mental buckets. The debt bucket feels bad. The
investment bucket feels good. But they're the *same balance sheet*. Your net worth is
(assets − debt), and it's growing. The two buckets are not independent — they're connected by
the spread.

### 7.4 Social Programming

"Neither a borrower nor a lender be." — Shakespeare

"The borrower is slave to the lender." — Proverbs 22:7

"Debt is dumb. Cash is king." — Dave Ramsey

You've been told since childhood that debt is morally wrong. This programming runs deep. It takes
active effort to override it with arithmetic.

## 8. When the Intuition Breaks (And You Should Repay)

The mental models above all assume one thing: **the asset grows faster than the debt.**

When that assumption breaks, the intuition reverses instantly:

| Scenario | What Happens | Action |
|:---------|:-------------|:-------|
| Asset return < borrow rate | The gap closes, then reverses | Repay |
| Borrow rate spikes to 15%+ | Cost of renting money becomes brutal | Repay |
| Asset crashes 50%+ | LTV spikes, liquidation risk | Add collateral or repay |
| You can't sleep at night | Psychology overrides math | Repay (seriously) |

**The employee gets fired when they stop being profitable.** If LINK returns drop below the borrow
rate for an extended period, the spread goes negative and every mental model above runs in reverse:
the seed is dying, the employee costs more than they earn, Account A is underperforming Account B,
the rent is too expensive for what you're getting.

**Monitor the spread. When it's positive, carry. When it turns negative, repay.**

---

## 9. The One Sentence

If you take nothing else from this post:

> **You don't repay cheap debt with appreciating assets for the same reason you don't sell your
> best stocks to pay off your mortgage — the grower outgrows the debt, and every dollar you
> divert from growth to repayment is a dollar that stops compounding.**

That's it. That's the whole insight. The rest is just overcoming 50 years of conditioning.

---

## 10. Making It Stick

Three exercises to internalize this:

**Exercise 1:** Open a spreadsheet. Put \$1,000 compounding at 30% in column A and \$1,000
compounding at 5% in column B. Drag it down 20 rows. Watch the gap. Feel it.

**Exercise 2:** Calculate how many LINK it costs to repay your debt *today* vs. in 3 years
(assuming 20% growth). Seeing the repayment get cheaper in LINK terms makes the time inversion
visceral.

**Exercise 3:** Calculate your daily rent. For a \$6,000 debt at 5%, it's \$0.82/day. Ask yourself
every morning: *"Am I willing to pay 82 cents today for the option on my LINK position?"* The
answer will always be yes.
