# Why Nobody Teaches You to Use Debt
## The Math Is Simple. The Silence Is Engineered.

## 1. The Puzzle

Here is the situation:

1. The government inflates the currency at 2–3% per year. This is not hidden. The Fed has an
   explicit 2% target. They *announce* it.

2. Fixed-rate debt is denominated in nominal dollars. If you borrow \$100 today and inflation
   runs at 3%, you repay in dollars that are worth less every year. The real weight of the debt
   *shrinks automatically*.

3. If you invest borrowed capital in an asset that appreciates faster than the interest rate,
   you profit on the spread. The math is elementary:

$$\text{If } r_{\text{asset}} > r_{\text{borrow}}, \text{ then } \text{debt} = \text{free money over time}$$

This isn't advanced mathematics. A high school student can verify it in a spreadsheet. The
government *tells you* they're inflating the currency. The Fed publishes the target. Borrow
rate data is public. Asset return histories are public.

**And yet: almost nobody uses this.**

The median American has \$8,000 in savings, no investment strategy, and treats all debt as a moral failing.
The median American retires with less than \$100,000 in total assets after 40+ years of working.

Why? Why does an idea this simple, this well-supported, this *obvious* once you see it — remain
invisible to 95% of the population?

The answer is not stupidity. The answer is that **every major institution in society has an
incentive to keep you ignorant of this**, and your own evolutionary psychology cooperates perfectly.

## 2. The Institutional Conspiracy (That Isn't a Conspiracy)

Nobody sat in a room and decided to hide the math of strategic debt from the public. That's not
how it works. What happened is worse: **every institution independently benefits from your
financial ignorance**, and the result looks like coordination even though it's emergent.

### 2.1 Banks Want Depositors, Not Borrowers-Who-Understand

Banks make money two ways:

1. **Lending spread**: Borrow from depositors at 0.5%, lend to borrowers at 6%. The spread is profit.
2. **Deposit base**: Your savings account funds their lending. They *need* your deposits.

Now consider what happens if everyone understood strategic debt:

- People would *borrow* at 6% and invest at 10%+, keeping the spread for themselves
- People would *stop saving* in 0.5% accounts, because they'd realize inflation eats their savings
- Banks would lose their cheap funding source (your deposits) and their best customers
  (people who repay loans quickly out of fear)

**The ideal bank customer is someone who:**
- Saves diligently (provides cheap deposits)
- Borrows reluctantly and repays as fast as possible (low default risk, high interest payments)
- Never realizes that their savings account is losing purchasing power every year
- Never realizes that their mortgage is getting lighter every year without them doing anything

Banks don't need to *actively* suppress financial education. They just need to *not teach it*.
And they don't. Have you ever seen a bank advertisement that says "Borrow money and invest it — 
you'll come out ahead"? Of course not. They say "Save for your future" while paying you 0.5%
in an environment where inflation is 3%.

**The bank is paying you −2.5% real to store your money, and marketing it as a virtue.**

### 2.2 The Government Wants Quiet Inflation

The government has an *explicit* policy of 2% inflation. Why?

1. **It makes debt cheaper to repay.** The US government is the world's largest debtor
   (\$34+ trillion). Inflation at 3% erodes ~\$1 trillion of that debt per year in real terms.
   The government is doing *exactly* what this blog series recommends: borrowing at fixed rates
   and letting inflation shrink the real burden.

2. **It discourages hoarding.** If cash loses value, people spend and invest. This stimulates
   economic activity. Deflation (rising currency value) causes people to hoard cash and
   economies to stall.

3. **It provides a hidden tax.** Inflation transfers wealth from savers to borrowers, from
   creditors to debtors. The government is a net debtor. Inflation is a tax that requires no
   legislation, no vote, no political fight.

But here's the catch: **the government cannot openly say "borrow money and invest it, because
we're going to inflate your debt away."** If they said this:

- Everyone would borrow aggressively → interest rates would spike
- Nobody would buy government bonds → the government couldn't fund itself
- Faith in the dollar would collapse → hyperinflation risk

So the government inflates quietly, publishes the data for anyone who looks, and absolutely
does not advertise the implication. The Fed chair will say "we target 2% inflation for price
stability." They will never say "we target 2% inflation so that debt becomes cheaper over time
and our \$34 trillion obligation shrinks in real terms."

**Same policy. One framing makes you save. The other makes you borrow. They choose the framing.**

### 2.3 The Education System Teaches Obedience, Not Strategy

What does school teach about money?

- "Save 10% of your income"
- "Don't spend more than you earn"
- "Pay off your debts as fast as you can"
- "The power of compound interest" (always illustrated with *savings*, never with *debt*)

What school does *not* teach:

- The real interest rate (nominal minus inflation)
- How inflation erodes debt
- The Kelly criterion for optimal leverage
- Why the wealthy borrow against assets instead of selling them
- How to evaluate whether debt is profitable
- How the monetary system is *designed* to benefit borrowers

This isn't an accident. The education system is designed to produce employees, not capital
allocators. Employees need to show up, follow instructions, and save enough to not be a
burden on the state. They do not need to understand monetary policy.

> **The school system teaches you the *arithmetic* of compound interest (for savings accounts)
> and deliberately omits the *algebra* of leverage (for wealth building).**

Think about that. They teach you $A = P(1 + r)^t$ — always with $P$ = your savings. Never
with $P$ = borrowed capital, $r$ = asset return, compared against debt cost. Same formula.
Different input. Wildly different life outcome. The formula they teach you makes the bank richer.
The formula they don't teach you makes *you* richer.

### 2.4 Financial Advisors Sell Products, Not Knowledge

A financial advisor makes money by:

1. Managing your assets (1% annual fee on AUM)
2. Selling you products (mutual funds, insurance, annuities)

What *doesn't* make them money:

- Teaching you to borrow at 4% and invest at 12%
- Explaining that inflation erodes your conservative bond portfolio
- Showing you that leveraged exposure to quality assets outperforms their managed portfolio
- Helping you use DeFi protocols with no intermediary fees

If you understood strategic debt, you would:
- Need the advisor less (the strategy is simple and self-managing)
- Hold leveraged positions (which advisors can't recommend due to liability)
- Use protocols like Aave (which cut out the financial industry entirely)

**The financial industry is a \$100+ trillion ecosystem that exists because most people don't
understand a one-line inequality: $r_{\text{asset}} > r_{\text{borrow}}$.**

### 2.5 Media Reinforces Fear

Financial media has a business model: **attention through fear.**

Headlines that generate clicks:
- "Americans drowning in debt!"
- "Credit card balances hit all-time high!"
- "Student loan crisis threatens economy!"
- "Are we heading for a debt-fueled recession?"

Headlines that don't generate clicks:
- "Strategic borrowing at 4% to invest at 12% continues to work, as it has for centuries"
- "Inflation quietly reduced real mortgage burden by 3% again this year"
- "Wealthy families maintain perpetual debt positions, net worth continues to grow"

The media doesn't distinguish between:
- **Consumer debt** (credit cards at 20% for consumption — *actually bad*)
- **Strategic debt** (low-rate borrowing for appreciating assets — *wealth building*)

They lump it all together as "debt" and paint it as universally dangerous. This serves the
narrative, the clicks, and the advertisers (banks selling savings products). It does not serve you.

## 3. The Evolutionary Trap

Institutions only succeed at keeping you ignorant because your brain *cooperates*. Evolution
wired you to fear debt, and the wiring is deep.

### 3.1 Loss Aversion Is 2-to-1

Nobel Prize–winning research by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky showed that **losses feel
roughly twice as painful as equivalent gains feel pleasurable.** Losing \$100 hurts about as
much as gaining \$200 feels good.

Now apply this to debt:

- **The debt payment** is a *certain* loss. Every month, money leaves your account. You feel it.
  It hurts. It's concrete and visceral.
- **The asset appreciation** is an *uncertain* gain. Your LINK might go up 25% this year. Or it
  might drop 30% first. The gain is abstract, probabilistic, and in the future.

Your brain weighs the certain loss at 2× and the uncertain gain at 0.5× (because it's uncertain).
So the *felt* cost-benefit ratio is:

$$\text{Felt ratio} = \frac{0.5 \times \text{expected gain}}{2 \times \text{certain cost}} = \frac{0.5}{2} \times \frac{\text{gain}}{\text{cost}} = 0.25 \times \frac{\text{gain}}{\text{cost}}$$

Even if the gain is 4× the cost (objectively amazing), your brain evaluates it as $0.25 \times 4 = 1.0$ — breakeven. *This is why people reject obviously profitable debt.* Their felt cost-benefit is compressed by a factor of 4.

To *feel* good about strategic debt, you'd need the gain to be 8× the cost, so
your brain computes $0.25 \times 8 = 2.0$. But at 8× gain-to-cost ratio, the strategy is
absurdly profitable — and most people still won't do it because they anchor on the cost.

### 3.2 Ancestral Debt Was Slavery

For most of human history, debt was not a financial instrument. It was *bondage*.

- In ancient Rome, unpaid debtors could be sold into slavery.
- In medieval Europe, debtors' prisons were real — you went to jail until someone paid your debt.
- In colonial America, indentured servitude was debt repayment through forced labor.
- Even in the early 20th century, owing money meant social shame, family disgrace, and real
  consequences (loss of property, livelihood, community standing).

For thousands of years, the message was burned into human culture: **debt = danger, shame, loss
of freedom.** This was accurate *in those environments*. If you owed money to a Roman creditor,
you should be terrified.

But the modern financial system is *nothing like this*. Your Aave position won't send you to
debtors' prison. Your fixed-rate mortgage can't be called early. Your USDC debt doesn't carry
social stigma. The *environment* has changed completely, but the *emotional response* hasn't
updated. You're running ancestral software in a modern environment.

> **Your amygdala doesn't know the difference between owing money to a Roman slave-owner and
> owing USDC to a smart contract. It fires the same fear signal for both.**

### 3.3 Uncertainty Feels Like Danger

The human brain evolved in an environment where uncertainty correlated with danger:

- Unknown rustling in the grass → potential predator → run
- Unfamiliar food → potential poison → don't eat
- New territory → unknown threats → stay close to camp

This served us well on the savanna. It does *not* serve us well in financial markets.

Strategic debt involves uncertainty:
- Will the asset appreciate enough to cover the interest? (*Probably, but uncertain.*)
- What if the market crashes? (*You survive if positioned correctly, but it's scary.*)
- What if rates change? (*They might, but the strategy is robust to reasonable changes.*)

The correct response to this uncertainty is *analysis*: calculate the expected value, assess the
risk, size the position appropriately (Kelly criterion), maintain reserves.

The *evolved* response is: **avoid.** Don't borrow. Stay in cash. The uncertain outcome
triggers the same neural circuitry as "unknown predator in the grass."

This is why even people who *understand the math* often don't act on it. Understanding is
cognitive (prefrontal cortex). Fear is emotional (amygdala). And the amygdala has veto power.
You can *know* that the debt is profitable and still *feel* that it's dangerous. When knowledge
and feeling conflict, feeling usually wins.

### 3.4 Social Proof Reinforces the Default

Humans are social animals. We take cues from the group:

- If nobody around you uses strategic debt, it *feels* wrong
- If everyone saves in bank accounts, that *feels* safe
- If your parents taught "always pay off debt first," contradicting them *feels* disrespectful
- If your friends think borrowing to invest is "gambling," doing it *feels* reckless

The irony: **the wealthy *do* use strategic debt.** But wealthy people are a small minority,
and they don't broadcast their balance sheets. So the social proof you actually encounter —
from family, friends, coworkers, internet forums — all points toward "debt bad, saving good."

You're copying the financial behavior of people who aren't wealthy, and wondering why you
aren't building wealth.

## 4. The Knowledge Stack Problem

Even if someone overcomes institutional programming and evolutionary fear, there's a genuine
intellectual barrier. Strategic debt requires understanding *multiple concepts simultaneously*,
and most people never acquire the full stack.

### The required knowledge stack

| Concept | Where taught? | % who know it |
|:--------|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Compound interest | High school math | ~60% |
| Inflation erodes purchasing power | News (vaguely) | ~40% |
| Nominal vs real interest rates | Econ 101 (college) | ~15% |
| Debt can have a *positive* expected value | Nowhere in standard curriculum | ~5% |
| Kelly criterion / position sizing | Graduate-level finance | ~1% |
| Inflation as a *structural* debt eraser | Monetary economics | ~2% |
| How to actually execute (Aave, margin, etc.) | Self-taught | ~0.5% |

Each concept alone is simple. But you need **all of them together** to reach the conclusion
"I should borrow at 4% to invest in appreciating assets and let inflation erode the debt."

Missing any single piece breaks the chain:

- Know compound interest but not real rates? → You save in a 0.5% account and feel smart
- Know inflation but not leverage? → You buy gold and worry
- Know leverage but not position sizing? → You over-leverage and get wiped out
- Know everything but not execution? → You understand but can't act

**The system doesn't hide any single piece. It just never assembles them for you.** Each piece
lives in a different silo (math class, economics class, finance industry, DeFi community), and
nobody connects them.

Except, apparently, this blog.

## 5. The Moral Framing Trap

Perhaps the most powerful barrier of all: **debt has been moralized.**

The word "debt" in English shares etymological roots with concepts of guilt and obligation.
In German, *Schuld* means both "debt" and "guilt" — literally the same word. In many
languages, "to owe" and "to ought" are linguistically intertwined.

This is not coincidental. Religions have reinforced the moral dimension for millennia:

- **Christianity**: "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors" (Matthew 6:12). Debt is
  framed as sin requiring forgiveness.
- **Islam**: Prohibits *riba* (interest/usury). Debt with interest is haram.
- **Judaism**: The Jubilee year (every 50 years) required forgiveness of all debts — implying
  debt is a burden to be escaped.
- **Buddhism**: Debt creates attachment, which is the root of suffering.
- **Hinduism**: *Rina* (debt) is a cosmic obligation — you are born into debt to gods, teachers,
  and ancestors.

Across every major moral tradition, debt is cast as a *negative state* — something to be avoided,
escaped, or forgiven. Never as a *tool*. Never as a *strategy*. Always as a *burden*.

When you internalize this framing (and everyone does, whether religious or not, because it's
embedded in the culture), every financial decision gets filtered through a moral lens:

- "I should pay off my mortgage" = *righteous*
- "I should keep my mortgage and invest" = *irresponsible*
- "I should borrow more" = *reckless, possibly sinful*
- "Debt-free" = *virtuous, clean, good*

**The math has no morality. But you do.** And your morality tells you debt is wrong before your
calculator tells you it's profitable.

This is why Dave Ramsey is popular. Not because his math is good — it isn't. His advice to pay
off a 3% mortgage while investing in the stock market at 10% is mathematically *insane*. But
his advice *feels righteous*. He speaks to the moral brain, not the mathematical brain. And for
most people, the moral brain wins.

## 6. The Selection Effect

There's a subtle feedback loop that keeps the knowledge suppressed:

1. **People who understand strategic debt get rich quietly.** They don't write "HOW I GOT RICH
   USING LEVERAGE" blog posts. They just... compound. Silently. For decades.

2. **People who don't understand it stay in the mainstream.** They consume mainstream financial
   media, follow mainstream advice, save in mainstream accounts.

3. **The mainstream never hears from the strategic debtors**, because those people have no
   incentive to broadcast their approach. (In fact, as discussed in the
   [Aave position post](/blog/defi/aave_link_position/), there are strong reasons to
   *hide* your positions.)

4. **The mainstream only hears debt horror stories**: credit card nightmares, student loan
   crises, mortgage defaults. These are the visible cases. The quiet leveraged millionaires
   are invisible.

So the public narrative is dominated by debt failures, not debt successes. And the conclusion
seems obvious: debt is dangerous. Case closed.

But you're looking at a *selection bias*. The failures are loud. The successes are silent. If
you only hear the failures, you conclude debt is bad — not because it is, but because success
doesn't make noise.

## 7. The Paradox of Widespread Adoption

Here's the final twist, and it's the one that makes this genuinely interesting:

**If everyone understood strategic debt, the strategy would stop working.**

Why? Several mechanisms:

### 7.1 Interest rates would rise

If everyone tried to borrow at 4% to invest:
- Demand for borrowing would skyrocket
- Supply of lending capital would drop (fewer savers)
- Interest rates would rise until the spread narrowed to near zero
- The Aave USDC borrow rate would jump from 3.8% to 15%+

### 7.2 Asset prices would inflate (more)

If everyone borrowed to buy assets:
- Asset prices would surge
- Expected future returns would drop (you're buying at higher prices)
- The $r_{\text{asset}} > r_{\text{borrow}}$ inequality would narrow

### 7.3 The strategy requires a counterparty

For every strategic borrower, there must be a lender. Lenders provide capital at rates below
the asset return — they're taking the worse side of the trade. If lenders understood this, they'd
demand higher rates.

**The strategy works *because* most people save, fear debt, and lend cheaply.** Their fear is
your edge. Their deposits fund your leverage. Their ignorance is the spread.

This creates a bizarre equilibrium:
- The knowledge can't spread too widely, or it self-destructs
- The people who benefit from it have no incentive to popularize it
- The institutions that could teach it have incentives to suppress it
- The psychology that could overcome the fear is the hardest thing to change

**Strategic debt is an edge that depends on most people not having it.** It is, in a real sense,
*inherently esoteric* — not because it's complex, but because widespread adoption would
eliminate the conditions that make it work.

---

## 8. So What Do You Do?

Knowing all this, here's the actionable takeaway:

### 8.1 Recognize the programming

Every time you feel "I should pay off this debt," ask: is this *math* or *morality*? Run the
numbers. If $r_{\text{asset}} > r_{\text{borrow}}$, the math says keep the debt. If you still
want to pay it off, that's your evolutionary programming talking — not rationality.

### 8.2 Audit your information sources

- Is your financial advisor incentivized to teach you leverage? (No.)
- Is your bank incentivized to explain real interest rates? (No.)
- Is the financial media incentivized to present nuanced takes on debt? (No.)
- Is the school system designed to produce capital allocators? (No.)

You are surrounded by sources that benefit from your ignorance. Act accordingly.

### 8.3 Build the knowledge stack

If you're reading this blog, you're assembling the full stack:

| Post | Concept |
|:-----|:--------|
| [The Mathematics of Debt](/blog/finance/debt_finance/) | When debt is profitable (Kelly criterion) |
| [The Perpetual Debt Playbook](/blog/finance/perpetual_debt/) | How to manage debt that never matures |
| [Why Keeping Debt Feels Wrong](/blog/finance/debt_intuition/) | Five mental models to rewire intuition |
| [Inflation Is a Debt Eraser](/blog/finance/inflation_debt/) | The structural force that favors borrowers |
| This post | Why nobody teaches you any of this |

Each post is one piece. Together, they form the complete picture that no institution will ever
assemble for you.

### 8.4 Accept the discomfort

Strategic debt will *always* feel uncomfortable. That's not a bug — it's a feature. The
discomfort is what keeps most people away. It's what preserves the edge. If it felt good,
everyone would do it, and it would stop working.

The math doesn't need to feel good. It needs to be *correct*. And it is.

---

## 9. The Deepest Irony

The government *tells you* it's inflating the currency. The Fed *publishes* the target. The math
is *taught in high school*. The data is *freely available*. Everything you need to figure this
out is *public knowledge*.

And yet almost nobody figures it out.

Not because it's hidden. But because **every force in society — institutional, evolutionary,
cultural, moral, social — pushes you toward the conclusion that debt is bad and saving is good.**
You have to independently overcome *all* of these forces simultaneously to reach the opposite
conclusion.

That's not a conspiracy. It's something more robust: **an emergent equilibrium where ignorance
is self-reinforcing.**

- Banks profit from it → they don't disrupt it
- Government relies on it → they don't publicize it
- Schools perpetuate it → they don't teach alternatives
- Media feeds on it → they don't nuance it
- Psychology entrenches it → you don't question it
- Culture moralizes it → you feel guilty questioning it
- Social proof cements it → everyone around you confirms it

Breaking out of this requires exactly one thing: **doing the math yourself, ignoring how it
feels, and acting on the result.**

That's what this blog series is about.
