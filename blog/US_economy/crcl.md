# Circle Valuation Analysis: Two Perspectives

## Gene Chan's Base Case: Growth Overpowers Rate Cuts

Gene Chan argues that Circle (CRCL) has become a compelling value play after dropping back to its ~\$69 IPO price from a 280% post-IPO peak.

### The Core Thesis

Circle's main revenue driver is interest earned on the reserves backing USDC stablecoin. Chan's key insight: **USDC circulation growth will outpace Fed rate cuts**, keeping reserve income resilient.

**Current State:**
- USDC circulation: \$75.2B (as of writing)
- Q3 growth rate: 108% year-over-year
- Distribution margin: 38-39%

**Three Growth Scenarios (2025-2028):**
1. **Base Case (40% CAGR)**: Management's conservative guidance
2. **Expected Case (60% CAGR)**: Industry research consensus
3. **Best Case (100% CAGR)**: Maintaining current momentum

**The Valuation Play:**

Chan's article cited a \$17B market cap (stock was around \$69/share at time of writing). At that valuation:
- **Best case** (100% CAGR): 2x 2028 net reserve income
- **Base case** (40% CAGR): 6x 2028 net reserve income

**Update:** As of December 1, 2025, CRCL is trading at ~\$78/share with a market cap of ~\$18.8B. At current prices:
- **Best case** (100% CAGR): ~2.2x 2028 net reserve income  
- **Base case** (40% CAGR): ~6.6x 2028 net reserve income

In other words, if the optimistic growth scenario plays out, you're buying future earnings incredibly cheaply at just ~2x. Still in value territory, though ~10% less compelling than when Chan wrote the piece.

### The Optionality Play

Beyond USDC reserves, Circle has multiple hypergrowth revenue streams:
- **EURC**: World's largest EUR-backed stablecoin
- **USDY**: Yield products
- **ARC blockchain**: Competing with Ethereum/Solana as a "stablecoin-native" platform
- **"Other Revenue"**: Grew 50,000% YoY in Q3 to \$28.5M

**My Take on ARC - The Hidden Paradigm Shift:** 

*That 50,000% figure is eye-popping but somewhat misleading given the "very low base" Chan mentions. However, there's a strategic angle both documents underappreciate: **ARC fundamentally changes Circle's business model.***

*Currently, Circle pays "rent" to external blockchain validators (Ethereum, Solana) via gas fees every time USDC moves. ARC flips this: it's a proprietary Layer-1 network that **uses USDC as its gas token**. This means:*

1. **Rent recapture**: Transaction fees flow back to Circle's ecosystem instead of to external validators
2. **Vertical integration**: Circle owns both the asset (USDC) and the settlement rail (ARC)
3. **Valuation re-rating**: This shifts Circle from a "bank with good NIM" to a "vertically integrated payments utility" - which deserves a much higher tech-driven multiple

*If ARC gains traction, Circle isn't just a stablecoin issuer collecting interest - it's a proprietary financial network where every transaction generates fees that stay in-house. That's a fundamentally different (and more valuable) business model. The question is execution and adoption, but the strategic optionality here is massive.*

## The Counter-Analysis: Structural Optionality via HQA Flexibility

The first document provides a more sophisticated counterpoint, arguing that Chan's analysis, while solid, **misses Circle's structural competitive advantage** from the GENIUS Act.

### The Key Blind Spot

Chan's model treats Circle's reserves as purely Treasury-dependent. But the GENIUS Act mandates **High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQAs)**, not exclusively Treasuries. This gives Circle crucial flexibility.

**The Strategic Hedge:**

If T-Bill yields fall significantly, Circle can rotate reserves into higher-yielding HQAs while maintaining regulatory compliance:

**Level 1 HQAs (Highest Quality):**
- Cash and FDIC-insured deposits
- Government agency securities
- Highly collateralized repos (overnight/7-day)
- Multilateral development bank debt

**Tiered HQAs (Subject to Caps):**
- GSE debt (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac)
- High-grade corporate commercial paper/bonds (AA- or higher, capped at ~40% of reserves)

### Why This Matters for Valuation

The author argues Chan's projection is "cyclical" while the HQA optionality provides a "structural" advantage:

1. **Higher NIM Floor**: Net Interest Margin has a higher floor than a Treasury-only portfolio
2. **Structural Resilience**: Acts as a hedge against severe, long-term rate compression
3. **Active Treasury Management**: Circle can optimize across the full HQA spectrum

**My Take:** *This is a sophisticated point that materially changes the risk profile. In a prolonged low-rate environment, the ability to capture spread by moving into higher-yielding (but still high-quality) assets could be the difference between decent returns and exceptional returns. However, this also introduces basis risk and credit risk that pure Treasuries don't have. The caps on corporate paper (40%) and haircuts mean this isn't unlimited optionality.*

## Synthesis: What's the Real Story?

**What They Agree On:**
- Circle is undervalued at current prices
- USDC growth is the primary driver
- Recent stock decline is disconnected from fundamentals

**The Critical Difference:**

Chan presents a **volume-driven value play**: Growth overcomes rate cuts.

The counter-analysis presents a **structural optionality play**: Growth PLUS regulatory flexibility creates a resilient NIM floor.

**My Assessment:** 

The HQA optionality argument is compelling and does add a layer of downside protection that pure volume-based models miss. However, it's worth noting:

1. **Execution Risk**: Actively managing a reserve portfolio across different HQAs requires sophisticated treasury operations. Can Circle execute this effectively?

2. **Regulatory Risk**: While the GENIUS Act provides the framework, regulatory interpretation could tighten over time, potentially limiting the practical use of this optionality.

   **However**, there's a compelling counter-argument: The U.S. has a severe debt problem, and stablecoin reserves represent a massive, stable bid for U.S. Treasuries. With USDC alone at \$75B+ and growing exponentially, stablecoins could become one of the largest Treasury buyers. This creates a powerful political incentive for the government to *maintain* favorable regulations and HQA flexibility - they need this demand for debt issuance. Regulatory tightening seems unlikely when stablecoins are effectively helping finance the deficit.

3. **Market Conditions**: The spread between Treasuries and other HQAs compresses in flight-to-quality scenarios. When would Circle actually benefit from this flexibility?

4. **The Free Option**: Both authors agree on one thing - you're getting multiple growth options (EURC, USDY, ARC) essentially for free if you buy at current valuations.

**Bottom Line:** Circle appears undervalued on the core USDC business alone. The HQA optionality adds a structural put option on NIM compression, while the ancillary businesses provide upside optionality. 

But the real paradigm shift is **ARC**: if successful, it transforms Circle from a margin-compression-vulnerable stablecoin issuer into a vertically integrated payments network that captures both NIM and transaction fees. Instead of just asking "what multiple should we pay for reserve income?", investors should ask "what's the value of owning the entire payments stack?"

For risk-tolerant investors, the asymmetry looks attractive - you're paying for a bank-like business but potentially getting a proprietary financial network.
