## What You Actually Need to Catch Up On

### Week 1-2: Financial Primitives
- How stablecoins work (30 minutes)

- Cross-chain bridges (network flow problems)

### Month 2: Domain Depth
- Treasury management strategies
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Risk modeling for DeFi protocols

**That's it.** The hard parts (CUDA, Bayesian methods, scalable ML, distributed systems) you already have. The easy parts (domain knowledge) you learn in 6-8 weeks.

## Your Immediate Playbook

### Path 1: Infrastructure Layer (Highest Leverage)
Join or start a company building:

- Bayesian optimization → automated treasury management
- Interpretability work → regulatory compliance AI

**The composability explosion needs someone who can build infrastructure that doesn't exist yet. That's literally what you did for computational biology.**

---

## The Translation Layer You Need

When talking to crypto people, reframe your work:

| Your CV Says | You Should Say |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Bayesian optimization for oligonucleotide screening" | "Bayesian optimization for high-dimensional discrete search spaces under uncertainty" |
| "PPR-RNA binding site mapping with 150× speedup" | "Pattern matching in sequential data with custom CUDA kernels" |
| "Epistasis modeling for protein mutagenesis" | "Modeling interactive effects in high-dimensional combinatorial spaces" |
| "Sparse representations for biological sequences" | "Sparse feature learning for sequential data with interpretability constraints" |
| "Deep learning interpretations for genomics" | "Interpretable neural architectures for regulated domains" |

**You're not learning a new field—you're applying existing skills to a new domain.**

---

## Where Your Specific Skills Map

### ML/AI
- Financial primitive pricing
- Risk modeling
- Automated trading strategies
- Compliance detection
- Treasury optimization

### GPU
- Cryptographic acceleration

- Applying biological systems thinking to decentralized financial ecosystems

---

## The Catch-Up That Actually Matters

**Not technical knowledge—network building.**

Start:
1. Following crypto researchers on Twitter/X (Vitalik, Dan Robinson, Hasu, Tarun Chitra)
2. Reading protocol documentation (Uniswap, Aave, Compound)
3. Attending crypto conferences (EthCC, Devcon, TOKEN2049)
4. Contributing to open-source DeFi protocols (MEV research, optimization tools)

---

## The Bottom Line

The GENIUS Act insight: **"This is the financialization of code itself"**

Every financial operation becomes a computational problem. For CS PhDs, this is the rare moment where deep technical skills become directly monetizable at massive scale without needing traditional finance credentials.

**The smartest move:** Focus on infrastructure that enables the "Cambrian explosion" predicted in the analysis. Build tools that let others innovate rather than building specific financial products. That's where sustained competitive advantage lies.

**The financial opportunity is so large and moving so fast that being 6 months behind on domain knowledge is irrelevant. Being able to build production infrastructure is what matters.**

---

## You're Not Behind

Your PhD was perfect preparation for a market that's about to explode. Unlike most people entering crypto from finance or CS, you have production-grade HPC and optimization skills that are desperately needed.

**You're just about to realize it.**
