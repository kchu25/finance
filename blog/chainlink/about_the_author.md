# Why Is a Ballet Dancer Turned CS PhD Writing Chainlink Analysis

## Full Disclosure

If you've been reading this blog — the measure theory posts, the Black-Scholes derivations, the stochastic processes, the 1,300-line Chainlink thesis with terminal value frameworks — you might have imagined the author as some finance quant or crypto-native degenerate who's been staring at charts since 2017.

Allow me to shatter that image.

I am a **postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University**. I study deep learning interpretations and computational methods for protein-DNA/RNA interactions. My day job involves sparse representations of biological sequences, not sparse liquidity on decentralized exchanges.

My PhD is in **computer science** from Washington University in St. Louis, where I worked with Gary Stormo — a pioneer in computational biology. I published in *Bioinformatics*. I write Julia packages for motif discovery. My academic blog posts have titles like "Soft-thresholding operator with [0,1] constraint" and "Differentiate the log-determinant of a matrix on GPU using Zygote.jl."

And before *any* of that?

I was a **professional ballet dancer.**

## The Resume That Makes Recruiters Short-Circuit

Let me lay out the career trajectory for full comedic effect:

**2004** — Quarterfinalist at the Prix de Lausanne (on a raked stage — ouch). I was a teenager from Taiwan competing against the world's best young dancers. Alex Wong won that year.

**2007-2010** — International ballet competition circuit. Seoul, Orlando (bronze medal), Helsinki (semi-finalist), Jackson (Capezio Award at the USA International Ballet Competition), Varna (eliminated first round — my friend Avetik did great though, and my roommate was Brooklyn Mack).

**Professional ballet career** — Danced with Zurich Ballet, Ballet West, New Jersey Ballet, and Kaohsiung City Ballet. Performed nearly every role in The Nutcracker. At Ballet West, I once played the Nutcracker himself, and my Fritz — Clara's naughty brother — was Nathan Chen. Yes, *that* Nathan Chen. The Olympic figure skating champion. He was a kid in the ballet before he became the greatest figure skater of his generation.

**Then** — Decided to... stop dancing? Moved to the US in 2008. Did a complete career pivot into computer science.

**PhD** — Spent years learning how DNA sequences encode regulatory information. Built deep learning models to find motifs — the short patterns in DNA where proteins bind. Published papers. Wrote Julia code. Stared at convolution operations until they started making sense.

**Postdoc at Columbia** — Currently developing computational methods for analyzing high-throughput functional genomics data. Collaborating with Chaolin Zhang's lab. Writing about sparse representations and deep unfolding.

**Meanwhile, on the side** — Apparently became obsessed with Chainlink's oracle economics, Aave lending strategies, measure theory foundations for options pricing, and the CLARITY Act's implications for digital asset classification.

You know. Normal stuff.

## The Part Where I Laugh at Myself

Let's be real about a few things:

**My career makes no linear sense.** There is no LinkedIn "career path" template for "ballet → CS PhD → genomics postdoc → crypto oracle thesis writer." If you showed my resume to a career counselor, they would assume it was AI-generated hallucination.

**I am not a finance professional.** I have never worked at a bank, a hedge fund, a trading desk, or even a fintech startup. My understanding of options pricing comes from reading textbooks and deriving Black-Scholes myself because I thought it was interesting. My understanding of Chainlink comes from reading every whitepaper, every DTCC report, and every Sergey Nazarov talk I could find — because I thought *that* was interesting too.

**My postdoc salary is... a postdoc salary.** If you know, you know. The fact that I'm writing detailed analyses about assets worth billions while being paid in the tradition of academic poverty is its own kind of comedy. Postdocs — we do it for the love of knowledge. And health insurance. Mostly health insurance.

**I write this blog in Julia.** Not Python, not JavaScript — Julia. A language that approximately 14 people use for web development. Using Franklin.jl, a static site generator that I chose because I already use Julia for my research. The website builds by executing Julia code. This is peak "academic who won't learn a normal tool" energy.

**I wrote 1,308 lines about Chainlink's investment thesis.** My actual published research paper is shorter than my Chainlink thesis. Let that sink in.

## Why This Background Might Actually Matter

Here's where the self-deprecation ends and I'll be a little serious.

I think my ridiculous career trajectory actually gives me an unusual perspective on Chainlink and crypto more broadly. Here's why:

### Pattern Recognition Across Domains

Ballet is about reading the music, anticipating the phrase, knowing where the weight needs to shift three counts before it happens. Computational biology is about finding faint patterns — motifs — hidden in noisy data. Crypto analysis is about recognizing structural patterns in markets that haven't fully priced in a technological shift.

These are all **pattern recognition problems.** The medium changes. The underlying cognitive process doesn't.

When I look at Chainlink's position in the oracle market, I'm not thinking like a crypto trader. I'm thinking like a computational biologist looking at a dataset. The signal is there. It's faint. Most people are looking at the wrong features. But the motif is present if you know how to extract it.

### Comfort with Long Time Horizons

A ballet career starts at age 8 and peaks at 28. You train for 20 years for a career that might last 10. You learn to think in decades, not quarters.

A PhD takes 5-7 years. A postdoc adds 2-5 more. You learn to invest enormous effort into something with uncertain and distant payoff.

These time horizons make me naturally comfortable with a thesis like "Chainlink will be worth 100x in 10 years." Most people can't hold a position for 10 months. I trained for 10 years to dance a 3-minute variation.

### Independent Thinking as a Survival Skill

When you leave professional ballet to study computer science, every single person in your life tells you you're crazy. When you then spend your evenings writing 400-line blog posts about oracle network economics instead of publishing more papers, your academic colleagues think *you've* gone crazy again.

At some point, you stop caring about consensus and start caring about whether you're *right*. That's a useful trait in markets where the consensus is almost always wrong at inflection points.

### Mathematical Foundations

I derive things from scratch. My blog has posts on measure theory, stochastic processes, the Hurst exponent. I wrote out the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test by hand. This isn't because I'm showing off — it's because my training taught me that you don't really understand something until you can derive it from first principles.

When I say Chainlink is undervalued, it's not because I read someone's tweet. It's because I sat down, built a terminal value framework, assigned probability distributions, and did the math. The math says the market is mispricing by a factor of 10-100x. The math could be wrong. But at least there *is* math.

## The Honest Truth

Here's the honest truth about why a genomics postdoc at Columbia is writing crypto analysis:

**I'm intellectually bored by staying in one lane.**

Ballet gave me artistry and discipline. Computer science gave me tools. Computational biology gave me a hard problem. But the intersection of cryptography, economics, game theory, legal frameworks, and technological infrastructure that Chainlink sits at? That's the most intellectually rich problem I've encountered since trying to figure out how transcription factors find their binding sites in 3 billion base pairs of DNA.

The oracle problem — how do you bring trustworthy real-world data on-chain — is a *beautiful* problem. It combines:

- **Computer science** (Byzantine fault tolerance, consensus mechanisms)
- **Economics** (incentive design, game theory, fee structures)
- **Law** (commodity classification, regulatory frameworks)
- **Finance** (valuation, market microstructure, supply dynamics)
- **Philosophy** (what is truth? how do you verify reality?)

I can't help it. My brain sees a multi-disciplinary problem like this and it goes feral.

## So Should You Trust My Analysis?

Probably not! I'm a ballet dancer turned bioinformatician writing about crypto from a Columbia postdoc office. My career path suggests I'm either a polymath or a person with severe commitment issues. Possibly both.

But here's what I'll say: I've been wrong about a lot of things in my life. I was wrong about ballet being a forever career. I was wrong about how long a PhD would take. I was probably wrong about at least three of the 47 blog posts on this site.

But I've also been right about a few non-obvious things — like the idea that sparse representations could reveal hidden motifs in DNA that other methods missed. That was a contrarian bet in my field, and it worked.

Chainlink at \$8.89 feels like the same kind of contrarian bet. The signal is faint. The consensus is wrong. And the pattern, once you see it, is unmistakable.

Or I'm completely delusional. In which case, at least I can still do a decent *tour en l'air*.
