## The Evolution: LinkPool → stake.link

### Understanding the Relationship

**stake.link is the evolved, DAO-controlled successor to LinkPool's original staking platform.** Here's how they connect:

#### **The Origin Story (2018-2022)**
- LinkPool started with the **LPL token** (raised ~705 ETH in 2018 crowdsale)
- Original focus: provide staking access to LinkPool's Chainlink nodes
- LPL holders could stake to earn a share of node operator fees

#### **The Pivot (December 2022)**
In late 2022, facing market challenges and runway concerns, LinkPool made a strategic decision to migrate from LPL to a broader vision: **stake.link**. This wasn't just a rebrand—it was an expansion from a single-node operator to a consortium-based liquid staking protocol.

**Key Changes:**
- **LPL → SDL migration** at 1:0.5 ratio (announced Dec 5, 2022)
- LinkPool received 50M SDL (originally planned for 10M) as founding member allocation
- 15 top Chainlink node operators joined as partners
- Transitioned from LinkPool revenue distribution to protocol-wide fee sharing
- Moved from centralized control to DAO governance

#### **What This Meant for LPL Holders**
The migration was controversial. LinkPool stopped distributing LINK rewards from its nodes to LPL holders (to maintain business sustainability) but compensated by:
- Allocating significant SDL tokens to LPL holders (15.66M SDL to community)
- Giving access to a broader ecosystem with 15 node operators instead of just one
- Participation in protocol governance through the DAO

## Major Projects & Their Impact

### 1. **LinkPool** (Co-founder & Tech Lead, 2018-present)

LinkPool is a comprehensive Chainlink ecosystem service provider. **As of 2022, it evolved from a standalone service into the founding technical contributor of stake.link.**

#### **Original LinkPool Platform (2018-2022)**
- Node staking with LPL token
- NaaS (Node as a Service)
- Market.link marketplace

#### **Current Role (2022-present)**
- **Core technical contributor** to stake.link DAO
- Operates as one of 15 participating node operators
- Holds seats on the Governance Council
- Continues development work funded by the DAO
- **Important:** While influential, LinkPool now operates within the DAO framework where the community holds ultimate power through reSDL votes and SLURPs (proposals)

### 2. **stake.link** (Founding Technical Lead, 2022-present)

**This is Jonny's current major project.** stake.link represents a complete paradigm shift in Chainlink staking.

#### **What is stake.link?**
A liquid delegated staking protocol for the Chainlink ecosystem that:
- Allows users to stake LINK and receive **stLINK** (liquid staking token)
- Provides access to higher yields by pooling deposits across Community Pool + Node Operator Pool
- Offers faster withdrawals (1-7 days vs 28-day native cooldown)
- Auto-compounds rewards through rebasing mechanism

#### **The Consortium Model**
stake.link is operated by **15 top-tier Chainlink node operators:**
- 01NODE, Framework Ventures, LinkPool, Chainlayer, Galaxy Digital, Inotel, LinkedRiver, LinkForest, OrionStaking, Matrixed.Link, Simply Stakin', Pier Two, Stakin, Tiingo, and stakefish
- Each brings their node operator allocation to the pool
- Community members delegate their LINK to these operators through the protocol

#### **Key Innovations**
1. **Priority Pool:** Intelligent queuing system based on SDL staking (not first-come-first-served)
2. **Liquid Staking Tokens:** stLINK is transferable, tradeable, usable as DeFi collateral
3. **Multi-Asset Vision:** Expanded to stPOL (Polygon staking), with plans for more LSTs
4. **Institutional Integration:** Recently adopted Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)

#### **The SDL Token Economy**
- **Total Supply:** 100M SDL (fixed, no inflation)
- **Utility:** Governance, fee distribution, priority staking access
- **reSDL System:** Stake SDL → receive reSDL NFTs with optional lock boosts (up to 9x for 48-month lock)
- **Fee Distribution:** SDL stakers earn from ALL protocol LSTs (stLINK, stPOL, future additions)

#### **Strategic Partnerships**
- **Chainlink Labs holds 7.7% of SDL supply** as ecosystem partner
- Integration with Chainlink CCIP, Automation, Price Feeds
- Security partnerships with Hypernative (monitoring) and Immunefi (bug bounties up to \$100k)

### 3. **Bridges** - Chainlink Adaptor Framework

Released in April 2019, this open-source tool revolutionized Chainlink adapter development:

- **Purpose:** Dramatically lowers the skill level needed to create Chainlink adapters
- **Features:** Provides a common interface and CLI for rapid adapter development
- **Impact:** Adapters can be defined in simple JSON or custom-built without worrying about Chainlink integration specifics
- **GitHub:** [linkpoolio/bridges](https://github.com/linkpoolio/bridges)

### 4. **Open Source Contributions**

Jonny's GitHub shows several significant projects:

- **chainlink-testing-framework** (SmartContract Kit) - Testing framework for smart contracts and Chainlink nodes
- **asset-price-cl-ea** - External adapter that aggregates crypto asset prices from multiple exchanges
- **example-chainlinks** - Example Chainlinks for the decentralized oracle network

## Key Innovations & Contributions

### Technical Achievements
1. **Smart Contract Innovations:** Built composable staking contracts that work across multiple blockchain networks
2. **On-chain Verification:** Developed verification contracts to prove node authenticity
3. **Automated Revenue Distribution:** Created the "KeeperSweeper" contract using Chainlink and Keep3r that automatically transfers rewards when thresholds are met
4. **DeFi Integration:** Built yield optimization strategies within staking pools

### Ecosystem Development
- Pioneered the concept of democratizing access to oracle node operation
- Created tools that make it easier for traditional businesses to become first-party oracles
- Worked on visualizing non-DeFi data feeds (weather data, tokenized luxury goods, etc.)
- Supported data providers in running their own nodes for greater decentralization

## stake.link DAO Structure & Governance

### Is it a DAO? **Yes, as of 2022.**

stake.link operates as a **representative democracy DAO** with a unique hybrid legal structure.

### **Governance Council (7 Members)**

The council is the elected body that ratifies proposals on behalf of the DAO. It requires **5 of 7 votes** to pass any decision.

**Council Composition:**
- **2 Core Contributors** (including LinkPool representatives)
- **1 NAIL** (Network Aligned Individual Liaison - hired contributors)
- **2 Community Members** (elected by reSDL holders every 6 months)
- **2 SDL Node Operators** (elected from the 15 participating node operators)

### **Who's in Charge?**

**Power Distribution:**
1. **Ultimate Authority:** reSDL holders (community) through voting on SLURPs (proposals)
2. **Operational Control:** 6-of-8 multi-sig wallet with 24-hour timelock
3. **Day-to-Day:** Governance Council ratifies proposals
4. **Technical Contribution:** LinkPool and other core contributors

**Multi-sig Signers (8 total, need 6 to execute):**
- Core protocol contributors
- Long-standing Chainlink node operators
- SDL DAO-elected representative
- Independent corporate services firm

### **How Governance Works**

1. **Proposals (SLURPs):** Anyone can submit stake.link Upgrade Request Proposals
2. **Discussion:** Minimum 1-week forum discussion at talk.stake.link
3. **Community Vote:** If no consensus, reSDL holders vote via Snapshot
4. **Council Ratification:** Governance Council votes to approve
5. **Execution:** Multi-sig executes after 24-hour timelock

### **Legal Wrapper: "stakedotlink Limited"**

- **Entity Type:** BVI (British Virgin Islands) company limited by guarantee
- **Purpose:** Enables real-world contracts, liability protection, tax neutrality
- **Novel Feature:** Any tokenholder can become a "guarantee member" with legal standing
- **Control:** Directed by Governance Council, including 2 community-elected seats

### **Key Principles**
- LinkPool bootstrapped and funded initial development
- LinkPool remains influential but doesn't have unilateral control
- Community + reSDL holders hold ultimate power through votes
- Decentralized but pragmatic (legal entity for real-world operations)

## Overall Assessment

Jonny Huxtable appears to be a **legitimate and technically skilled blockchain developer** with a strong track record in the Chainlink ecosystem. His work has:

- Lowered barriers to participation in oracle networks
- Created valuable infrastructure used by the broader community
- Earned recognition from Chainlink Labs through grants
- Maintained transparency and open-source contributions

**For users considering engagement:** LinkPool appears to be a legitimate Chainlink service provider, but as with any cryptocurrency or DeFi project, conduct your own research and understand the risks involved.
