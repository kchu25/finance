When there&#39;s high demand for US Treasury securities, buyers compete and drive up bond prices. Since bonds pay a fixed amount at maturity, paying more upfront for the same payout means lower returns &#40;interest rates&#41;.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong> A bond paying &#36;1,000 at maturity:</p> <ul> <li><p>Buy for &#36;900 → &#36;100 profit → 11&#37; return</p> <li><p>Buy for &#36;950 → &#36;50 profit → 5&#37; return</p> </ul> <p><strong>The Key:</strong> Massive global demand drives prices up &#40;to &#36;950 instead of &#36;900&#41;, which mathematically makes the interest rate lower &#40;5&#37; instead of 11&#37;&#41;. This saves the US government hundreds of billions annually in interest payments.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Cheaper Imports</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>A strong dollar reduces the cost of imported goods</p> <li><p>American households enjoy higher living standards through lower prices on foreign products</p> <li><p>Increased purchasing power for consumers and businesses</p> </ul> <blockquote> <p><strong>Why a Strong Dollar Makes Imports Cheaper</strong></p> <p>When the dollar is strong, it can buy more foreign currency, which means you need fewer dollars to purchase the same foreign goods.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong> Buying a product that costs €100 in Europe:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Weak dollar</strong> &#40;€1 &#61; &#36;1.20&#41;: You need &#36;120 to buy €100 worth of goods</p> <li><p><strong>Strong dollar</strong> &#40;€1 &#61; &#36;1.00&#41;: You need only &#36;100 to buy €100 worth of goods</p> <li><p><strong>Stronger dollar</strong> &#40;€1 &#61; &#36;0.90&#41;: You need only &#36;90 to buy €100 worth of goods</p> </ul> <p><strong>The Math:</strong> When the dollar strengthens from &#36;1.20/€ to &#36;0.90/€, the same European product becomes 25&#37; cheaper for American buyers &#40;&#36;120 → &#36;90&#41;. This applies to everything from electronics to cars to clothes imported into the US.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Financial Market Advantages</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Foreign banks maintain strong connections to the US financial system</p> <li><p>Increases credit availability in the US</p> <li><p>Creates deeper, more liquid financial markets</p> </ul> <blockquote> <p><strong>Why Foreign Banks Connect to the US Financial System</strong></p> <p>Since the dollar dominates global trade and finance, foreign banks need dollars to:</p> <ul> <li><p>Facilitate international trade for their clients &#40;most global trade is invoiced in dollars&#41;</p> <li><p>Hold dollar reserves to meet their own obligations</p> <li><p>Provide dollar-denominated loans and services</p> </ul> <p>To access dollars efficiently, foreign banks maintain accounts and relationships with US banks, creating a network where:</p> <ul> <li><p>Money flows more easily into US markets</p> <li><p>Foreign capital becomes available for US lending</p> <li><p>US financial institutions gain more customers and transaction volume</p> </ul> <p><strong>The Result:</strong> This interconnection means more money flows through US banks, increasing liquidity and making credit more available and cheaper for American borrowers.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id=political_and_strategic_power ><a href="#political_and_strategic_power" class=header-anchor >Political and Strategic Power</a></h3> <p><strong>Sanctions Leverage</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Dollar transactions typically use US banking infrastructure</p> <li><p>Gives the US powerful ability to enforce international sanctions</p> <li><p>Can freeze transactions and seize assets of sanctioned entities</p> <li><p>Effective non-military instrument for enforcing international order</p> </ul> <blockquote> <p><strong>Examples of US Sanctions Using Dollar Dominance</strong></p> <p><strong>Russia &#40;Ukraine War&#41;</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Over 2,500 Russia-related targets added to sanctions lists since February 2022, including President Vladimir Putin, high net-worth individuals, and supporters of the military-industrial complex</p> <li><p>Froze nearly half of the Bank of Russia&#39;s foreign exchange reserves in February 2022</p> <li><p>Targeted nearly a dozen sectors of the Russian economy including metals, aerospace, electronics, financial services, and defense</p> <li><p>Foreign banks engaging with Russia&#39;s military-industrial base face total exclusion from the US dollar-based global financial system</p> </ul> <p><strong>Iran</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Iran was the most sanctioned country in the world until surpassed by Russia in 2022</p> <li><p>Sanctioned networks providing materials for Iran&#39;s weapons programs, including front companies in Hong Kong obtaining US technology</p> <li><p>Targeted Iranian oil smuggling operations that funded groups like Hezbollah and Hamas</p> <li><p>Sanctioned procurement networks obtaining US goods for Iranian airlines and ballistic missile programs</p> </ul> <p><strong>How It Works</strong> Since most international transactions involve dollars and must pass through US banks or use the SWIFT system &#40;which connects to US financial infrastructure&#41;, the US can effectively block entities from accessing the global financial system. Sanctioned parties cannot conduct dollar transactions, access US markets, or do business with US entities—severely limiting their ability to operate internationally.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>&quot;Exorbitant Privilege&quot;</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Ability to conduct international transactions easily in home currency</p> <li><p>No exchange rate risk for US businesses in many international deals</p> <li><p>Monetary policy flexibility during crises</p> </ul> <h3 id=economic_resilience ><a href="#economic_resilience" class=header-anchor >Economic Resilience</a></h3> <p><strong>Safe-Haven Status</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>During global financial crises, investors rush to dollar-denominated assets</p> <li><p>Helps insulate the US economy from shocks originating elsewhere</p> <li><p>During the 2008 financial crisis, the dollar rose 26&#37; despite US being the epicenter</p> </ul> <h2 id=trade-offs_and_costs ><a href="#trade-offs_and_costs" class=header-anchor >Trade-offs and Costs</a></h2> <p><strong>Trade Deficits</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>High foreign demand strengthens the dollar, making US exports more expensive</p> <li><p>Can hurt domestic manufacturing and trade-competitive industries</p> <li><p>Contributes to job losses in export sectors</p> </ul> <p><strong>Increased Indebtedness</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>The US must absorb savings imbalances from other countries</p> <li><p>Forces the US to run deficits to offset other countries&#39; surpluses</p> </ul> <blockquote> <p><strong>Why Dollar Dominance Increases US Debt</strong></p> <p>Here&#39;s the paradox: When countries like China, Japan, or Germany run trade surpluses &#40;exporting more than they import&#41;, they accumulate dollars. They want to keep these dollars safe, so they invest them back into US Treasury bonds.</p> <p>This creates a cycle where:</p> <ol> <li><p>Foreign countries earn dollars from selling goods to the US</p> <li><p>They reinvest those dollars in US government debt &#40;Treasury bills, notes, and bonds&#41;</p> <li><p>This makes borrowing cheap for the US &#40;remember: high demand &#61; low interest rates&#41;</p> <li><p>Cheap borrowing encourages the US government to issue more Treasuries and run larger budget deficits &#40;spending more than tax revenue&#41;</p> <li><p>The strong dollar &#40;from all this demand&#41; makes US exports expensive and imports cheap</p> <li><p>This widens the trade deficit, sending more dollars abroad</p> <li><p>The cycle repeats</p> </ol> <p><strong>What &quot;Borrow More&quot; Means:</strong> The US government borrows by selling Treasury securities &#40;bills, notes, bonds&#41;. When interest rates are low due to foreign demand, the government can finance larger deficits more cheaply—spending on programs, defense, infrastructure, etc. without raising equivalent tax revenue. It&#39;s like being offered unlimited low-interest credit cards—convenient in the short term, but it can lead to mounting debt over time.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id=future_outlook ><a href="#future_outlook" class=header-anchor >Future Outlook</a></h2> <p>While the dollar&#39;s share of global reserves has declined from over 70&#37; in 2000 to 59&#37; today, it remains dominant by a wide margin. The dollar&#39;s position is supported by:</p> <ul> <li><p>Size and stability of the US economy</p> <li><p>Deep, liquid, and open capital markets</p> <li><p>Rule of law and institutional credibility</p> <li><p>Network effects and inertia in the global financial system</p> </ul> <p>However, challenges include increased use of sanctions, dedollarization efforts by some countries, and gradual diversification into other currencies.</p> <div class=page-foot > Contact me by <a href="mailto:skchu@wustl.edu">E-mail</a> | <a href="https://github.com/kchu25">Github</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kchu1/">Linkedin</a> <br> This work is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>.
