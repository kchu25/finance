<p>Gene Chan argues that Circle &#40;CRCL&#41; has become a compelling value play after dropping back to its ~&#36;69 IPO price from a 280&#37; post-IPO peak.</p>
<h3 id="the_core_thesis"><a href="#the_core_thesis" class="header-anchor">The Core Thesis</a></h3>
<p>Circle&#39;s main revenue driver is interest earned on the reserves backing USDC stablecoin. Chan&#39;s key insight: <strong>USDC circulation growth will outpace Fed rate cuts</strong>, keeping reserve income resilient.</p>
<p><strong>Current State:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>USDC circulation: &#36;75.2B &#40;as of writing&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Q3 growth rate: 108&#37; year-over-year</p>
</li>
<li><p>Distribution margin: 38-39&#37;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Three Growth Scenarios &#40;2025-2028&#41;:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Base Case &#40;40&#37; CAGR&#41;</strong>: Management&#39;s conservative guidance</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Expected Case &#40;60&#37; CAGR&#41;</strong>: Industry research consensus</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Best Case &#40;100&#37; CAGR&#41;</strong>: Maintaining current momentum</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Valuation Play:</strong></p>
<p>Chan&#39;s article cited a &#36;17B market cap &#40;stock was around &#36;69/share at time of writing&#41;. At that valuation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Best case</strong> &#40;100&#37; CAGR&#41;: 2x 2028 net reserve income</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Base case</strong> &#40;40&#37; CAGR&#41;: 6x 2028 net reserve income</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> As of December 1, 2025, CRCL is trading at ~&#36;78/share with a market cap of ~&#36;18.8B. At current prices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Best case</strong> &#40;100&#37; CAGR&#41;: ~2.2x 2028 net reserve income  </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Base case</strong> &#40;40&#37; CAGR&#41;: ~6.6x 2028 net reserve income</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, if the optimistic growth scenario plays out, you&#39;re buying future earnings incredibly cheaply at just ~2x. Still in value territory, though ~10&#37; less compelling than when Chan wrote the piece.</p>
<h3 id="the_optionality_play"><a href="#the_optionality_play" class="header-anchor">The Optionality Play</a></h3>
<p>Beyond USDC reserves, Circle has multiple hypergrowth revenue streams:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>EURC</strong>: World&#39;s largest EUR-backed stablecoin</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>USDY</strong>: Yield products</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>ARC blockchain</strong>: Competing with Ethereum/Solana as a &quot;stablecoin-native&quot; platform</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Other Revenue&quot;</strong>: Grew 50,000&#37; YoY in Q3 to &#36;28.5M</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Take on ARC - The Hidden Paradigm Shift:</strong> </p>
<p>*That 50,000&#37; figure is eye-popping but somewhat misleading given the &quot;very low base&quot; Chan mentions. However, there&#39;s a strategic angle both documents underappreciate: **ARC fundamentally changes Circle&#39;s business model.***</p>
<p><em>Currently, Circle pays &quot;rent&quot; to external blockchain validators &#40;Ethereum, Solana&#41; via gas fees every time USDC moves. ARC flips this: it&#39;s a proprietary Layer-1 network that <strong>uses USDC as its gas token</strong>. This means:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Rent recapture</strong>: Transaction fees flow back to Circle&#39;s ecosystem instead of to external validators</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Vertical integration</strong>: Circle owns both the asset &#40;USDC&#41; and the settlement rail &#40;ARC&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Valuation re-rating</strong>: This shifts Circle from a &quot;bank with good NIM&quot; to a &quot;vertically integrated payments utility&quot; - which deserves a much higher tech-driven multiple</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>If ARC gains traction, Circle isn&#39;t just a stablecoin issuer collecting interest - it&#39;s a proprietary financial network where every transaction generates fees that stay in-house. That&#39;s a fundamentally different &#40;and more valuable&#41; business model. The question is execution and adoption, but the strategic optionality here is massive.</em></p>

<h2 id="the_counter-analysis_structural_optionality_via_hqa_flexibility"><a href="#the_counter-analysis_structural_optionality_via_hqa_flexibility" class="header-anchor">The Counter-Analysis: Structural Optionality via HQA Flexibility</a></h2>
<p>The first document provides a more sophisticated counterpoint, arguing that Chan&#39;s analysis, while solid, <strong>misses Circle&#39;s structural competitive advantage</strong> from the GENIUS Act.</p>
<h3 id="the_key_blind_spot"><a href="#the_key_blind_spot" class="header-anchor">The Key Blind Spot</a></h3>
<p>Chan&#39;s model treats Circle&#39;s reserves as purely Treasury-dependent. But the GENIUS Act mandates <strong>High-Quality Liquid Assets &#40;HQAs&#41;</strong>, not exclusively Treasuries. This gives Circle crucial flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>The Strategic Hedge:</strong></p>
<p>If T-Bill yields fall significantly, Circle can rotate reserves into higher-yielding HQAs while maintaining regulatory compliance:</p>
<p><strong>Level 1 HQAs &#40;Highest Quality&#41;:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cash and FDIC-insured deposits</p>
</li>
<li><p>Government agency securities</p>
</li>
<li><p>Highly collateralized repos &#40;overnight/7-day&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multilateral development bank debt</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tiered HQAs &#40;Subject to Caps&#41;:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>GSE debt &#40;Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>High-grade corporate commercial paper/bonds &#40;AA- or higher, capped at ~40&#37; of reserves&#41;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why_this_matters_for_valuation"><a href="#why_this_matters_for_valuation" class="header-anchor">Why This Matters for Valuation</a></h3>
<p>The author argues Chan&#39;s projection is &quot;cyclical&quot; while the HQA optionality provides a &quot;structural&quot; advantage:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Higher NIM Floor</strong>: Net Interest Margin has a higher floor than a Treasury-only portfolio</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Structural Resilience</strong>: Acts as a hedge against severe, long-term rate compression</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Active Treasury Management</strong>: Circle can optimize across the full HQA spectrum</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> <em>This is a sophisticated point that materially changes the risk profile. In a prolonged low-rate environment, the ability to capture spread by moving into higher-yielding &#40;but still high-quality&#41; assets could be the difference between decent returns and exceptional returns. However, this also introduces basis risk and credit risk that pure Treasuries don&#39;t have. The caps on corporate paper &#40;40&#37;&#41; and haircuts mean this isn&#39;t unlimited optionality.</em></p>

<h2 id="synthesis_whats_the_real_story"><a href="#synthesis_whats_the_real_story" class="header-anchor">Synthesis: What&#39;s the Real Story?</a></h2>
<p><strong>What They Agree On:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Circle is undervalued at current prices</p>
</li>
<li><p>USDC growth is the primary driver</p>
</li>
<li><p>Recent stock decline is disconnected from fundamentals</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Critical Difference:</strong></p>
<p>Chan presents a <strong>volume-driven value play</strong>: Growth overcomes rate cuts.</p>
<p>The counter-analysis presents a <strong>structural optionality play</strong>: Growth PLUS regulatory flexibility creates a resilient NIM floor.</p>
<p><strong>My Assessment:</strong> </p>
<p>The HQA optionality argument is compelling and does add a layer of downside protection that pure volume-based models miss. However, it&#39;s worth noting:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Execution Risk</strong>: Actively managing a reserve portfolio across different HQAs requires sophisticated treasury operations. Can Circle execute this effectively?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Regulatory Risk</strong>: While the GENIUS Act provides the framework, regulatory interpretation could tighten over time, potentially limiting the practical use of this optionality.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, there&#39;s a compelling counter-argument: The U.S. has a severe debt problem, and stablecoin reserves represent a massive, stable bid for U.S. Treasuries. With USDC alone at &#36;75B&#43; and growing exponentially, stablecoins could become one of the largest Treasury buyers. This creates a powerful political incentive for the government to <em>maintain</em> favorable regulations and HQA flexibility - they need this demand for debt issuance. Regulatory tightening seems unlikely when stablecoins are effectively helping finance the deficit.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Market Conditions</strong>: The spread between Treasuries and other HQAs compresses in flight-to-quality scenarios. When would Circle actually benefit from this flexibility?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The Free Option</strong>: Both authors agree on one thing - you&#39;re getting multiple growth options &#40;EURC, USDY, ARC&#41; essentially for free if you buy at current valuations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Circle appears undervalued on the core USDC business alone. The HQA optionality adds a structural put option on NIM compression, while the ancillary businesses provide upside optionality. </p>
<p>But the real paradigm shift is <strong>ARC</strong>: if successful, it transforms Circle from a margin-compression-vulnerable stablecoin issuer into a vertically integrated payments network that captures both NIM and transaction fees. Instead of just asking &quot;what multiple should we pay for reserve income?&quot;, investors should ask &quot;what&#39;s the value of owning the entire payments stack?&quot;</p>
<p>For risk-tolerant investors, the asymmetry looks attractive - you&#39;re paying for a bank-like business but potentially getting a proprietary financial network.</p>
