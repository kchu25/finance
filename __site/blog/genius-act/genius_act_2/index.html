But let me fill in what&#39;s NOT covered and what this actually means for crypto, tokenization, and your daily life.</p> <h2 id=whats_missing_from_the_article ><a href="#whats_missing_from_the_article" class=header-anchor >What&#39;s Missing from the Article</a></h2> <h3 id=the_privacy_trade-off_nobodys_talking_about ><a href="#the_privacy_trade-off_nobodys_talking_about" class=header-anchor ><ol> <li><p><strong>The Privacy Trade-off Nobody&#39;s Talking About</strong></p> </ol> </a></h3> <p>The article celebrates programmable compliance, but here&#39;s the uncomfortable reality: every transaction on a public blockchain is <em>permanently visible</em>. </p> <p>Right now, your bank knows what you buy, but at least that data isn&#39;t public. With stablecoins on transparent blockchains:</p> <ul> <li><p>Anyone can see wallet balances</p> <li><p>Transaction flows are traceable forever</p> <li><p>Your coffee purchase at 8am links to your wallet, which links to everything else</p> </ul> <p>Yes, there are privacy coins and zero-knowledge solutions, but the GENIUS Act doesn&#39;t mandate privacy-preserving tech. We&#39;re potentially trading banking monopolies for surveillance infrastructure that makes the current system look private by comparison.</p> <h3 id=ol_start2_the_stablecoin_issuer_oligopoly_risk ><a href="#ol_start2_the_stablecoin_issuer_oligopoly_risk" class=header-anchor ><ol start=2 > <li><p><strong>The Stablecoin Issuer Oligopoly Risk</strong></p> </ol> </a></h3> <p>The article mentions banks losing their monopoly, but who&#39;s filling that vacuum? </p> <p>Circle &#40;USDC&#41;, Tether &#40;USDT&#41;, and maybe a handful of banks willing to play ball. That&#39;s not exactly decentralization—it&#39;s just shifting from 4,000&#43; US banks to maybe 5-10 stablecoin issuers who will have <em>massive</em> power.</p> <p>What happens when:</p> <ul> <li><p>Circle decides to freeze your wallet? &#40;They already can and do for compliance&#41;</p> <li><p>A stablecoin issuer goes bankrupt?</p> <li><p>Geopolitical pressure forces them to block certain users or countries?</p> </ul> <p>We&#39;re replacing &quot;too big to fail&quot; banks with &quot;too systemic to challenge&quot; stablecoin issuers.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>The Shadow Central Bank Problem</strong></p> <p>Here&#39;s the part that should keep the Fed up at night: stablecoin issuers could potentially act as a <em>counterforce</em> to Federal Reserve monetary policy.</p> <p>Think about how monetary policy works: the Fed raises interest rates to cool down the economy by making borrowing expensive and saving attractive. Money flows out of risky assets, into banks, the economy slows. This works because the Fed controls the banking system&#39;s reserve requirements and can influence where money flows.</p> <p>But now imagine Circle and Tether are sitting on &#36;1&#43; trillion in stablecoins, backed by T-bills earning 4-5&#37;. Recent Fed analysis suggests stablecoin growth could put downward pressure on the neutral interest rate &#40;r*&#41;, potentially complicating monetary policy implementation.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the nightmare scenario for the Fed:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Fed tries to tighten</strong>: Raises rates to 6&#37; to fight inflation</p> <li><p><strong>Stablecoin issuers respond</strong>: Instead of money flowing into traditional bank deposits, it flows into stablecoins because they&#39;re more liquid and have 24/7 accessibility</p> <li><p><strong>The transmission mechanism breaks</strong>: Traditional banks lose deposits, but stablecoin issuers just park everything in Treasuries. The Fed&#39;s rate hikes don&#39;t bite the economy as hard as intended.</p> <li><p><strong>Monetary policy loses effectiveness</strong>: The Fed&#39;s main tool for managing the economy gets partially neutered</p> </ol> <p>Even scarier: research indicates that stablecoin outflows impact Treasury yields two to three times more than inflows lower them—creating &quot;redemption asymmetry.&quot; When people panic-redeem stablecoins during a crisis, Treasury markets could experience amplified shocks.</p> <p>This is why some analysts argue the GENIUS Act &quot;bypasses the Federal Reserve&quot; and creates stablecoin issuers as &quot;forced buyers&quot; of government debt. By requiring stablecoins to be fully backed by Treasuries and similar assets, the system transforms payment stablecoin issuers into narrow banks whose main economic role is converting global demand for digital dollars into structural demand for short-term US sovereign debt.</p> <p>The Fed doesn&#39;t control Circle or Tether the way it controls JPMorgan or Bank of America. These entities can move trillions without asking permission. They&#39;re essentially creating a parallel monetary system that responds to different incentives than traditional banks.</p> <p>As Fed Governor Brainard noted, widespread stablecoin adoption could shrink demand for physical cash, affect the central bank&#39;s balance sheet size, and complicate monetary policy implementation if banks&#39; participation in short-term funding markets changes.</p> <p>The endgame question: What happens when a crisis hits and the Fed needs to intervene, but finds that &#36;3-4 trillion of the dollar monetary system is locked in stablecoin infrastructure that doesn&#39;t respond to traditional monetary policy tools? The Fed would likely have to provide emergency liquidity—effectively becoming the lender of last resort to private stablecoin issuers, creating a &quot;de facto central bank backstop&quot; for what was supposed to be private-sector innovation.</p> <p>So yes, stablecoin issuers have the <em>potential</em> to counteract Fed policy—not intentionally, but structurally. They&#39;re building a parallel financial system that doesn&#39;t play by the Fed&#39;s rules. That&#39;s either brilliant innovation or a recipe for the next systemic crisis, depending on how this plays out.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id=ol_start3_the_technical_infrastructure_challenges ><a href="#ol_start3_the_technical_infrastructure_challenges" class=header-anchor ><ol start=3 > <li><p><strong>The Technical Infrastructure Challenges</strong></p> </ol> </a></h3> <p>The article assumes blockchain infrastructure is ready for prime time. It&#39;s not—though to be fair, it&#39;s getting <em>way</em> better than people realize:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Scalability - The Real Picture</strong>: Yes, Ethereum&#39;s base layer only does around 18 TPS currently. But you&#39;re right—there ARE other chains, and Ethereum moved to Proof of Stake in 2022. However, PoS didn&#39;t directly increase TPS on the base layer &#40;it&#39;s about energy efficiency and security&#41;, so Ethereum still processes roughly the same number of transactions per second as before. The real scaling comes from Layer 2 solutions and alternative chains:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Solana</strong>: Currently averaging 800-1,500 TPS in practice &#40;with theoretical max of 65,000 TPS&#41;. During peak memecoin activity in April 2024, it hit over 5,000 TPS. Still far from Visa&#39;s 65,000, but getting closer.</p> <li><p><strong>Layer 2s on Ethereum</strong>: Arbitrum &#40;~10-45 TPS in practice&#41;, Base &#40;~5-37 TPS&#41;, Optimism, Polygon &#40;~38 TPS&#41;—these bundle transactions off-chain and settle on Ethereum for security.</p> <li><p><strong>High-throughput chains</strong>: Sonic &#40;integrated with Chainlink CCIP&#41; achieves 10,000 TPS with sub-second finality. Jovay &#40;an Ethereum L2 by Ant Financial&#41; is scaling from 20,000 to 100,000 TPS, specifically targeting institutional RWA markets.</p> <li><p><strong>The catch</strong>: When you add up Ethereum &#43; all its major L2s, you get maybe ~500 TPS combined. Better, but still not Visa-scale.</p> </ul> <p><strong>Wait, what about Chainlink?</strong> Good question, but Chainlink isn&#39;t actually a blockchain—it&#39;s an interoperability protocol. Chainlink CCIP &#40;Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol&#41; doesn&#39;t have its own TPS limitation because it operates <em>across</em> chains as a messaging and verification layer, not as a transaction processor. Think of it as the &quot;internet protocol layer&quot; for blockchains rather than a blockchain itself. </p> <p>CCIP itself isn&#39;t bottlenecked by TPS—it&#39;s a decentralized oracle network that validates and routes cross-chain messages. The actual constraints on moving assets between chains come from:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The source and destination blockchains&#39; TPS</strong> &#40;CCIP can&#39;t make Ethereum finalize faster than 12 seconds&#41;</p> <li><p><strong>Security rate limits</strong> set by token issuers like Circle &#40;policy decisions, not CCIP&#39;s technical limit&#41;</p> <li><p><strong>Destination chain gas limits</strong> for executing the received message</p> </ul> <p>But CCIP&#39;s own capacity to verify and route messages? That scales horizontally with more oracle nodes and can handle massive parallel throughput across hundreds of blockchain lanes simultaneously. It&#39;s designed for the multi-chain future where stablecoins and tokenized assets need to move seamlessly between Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, Base, and dozens of other chains. When institutions need to move &#36;100M in tokenized Treasuries from Ethereum to Solana, CCIP provides the security layer—the speed depends on the chains themselves, not CCIP&#39;s capacity.</p> <p>So the scalability problem is <em>improving</em> but not solved. The bet is that by the time mass adoption happens, Layer 2s and alt-chains will have scaled enough. That&#39;s optimistic but not impossible—especially with new chains hitting 10,000-100,000 TPS specifically for institutional use.</p> <li><p><strong>Gas fees during congestion</strong>: This is where L2s and Solana actually shine. Solana transactions average &#36;0.008 &#40;less than a penny&#41;, and L2s like Arbitrum are &#36;0.10-&#36;0.20. Even during congestion, they&#39;re manageable. But yes, Ethereum base layer can still hit &#36;50&#43; during peak times—which is why stablecoins will likely live on L2s or alt-chains, not Ethereum mainnet.</p> <li><p><strong>Smart contract bugs</strong>: Your money lives in code. Code has bugs. The Ronin Bridge hack &#40;&#36;625M&#41;, Poly Network &#40;&#36;611M&#41;, and countless others prove this.</p> </ul> <p>The article talks about &quot;permissionless innovation&quot; but doesn&#39;t mention that with code-based finance, one semicolon error can drain millions instantly with no recourse.</p> <h3 id=ol_start4_the_fdic_insurance_question ><a href="#ol_start4_the_fdic_insurance_question" class=header-anchor ><ol start=4 > <li><p><strong>The FDIC Insurance Question</strong></p> </ol> </a></h3> <p>Your bank deposits are FDIC insured up to &#36;250K. Stablecoins? Not insured at all.</p> <p>The article mentions this vaguely but doesn&#39;t emphasize: if your stablecoin issuer fails or gets hacked, you&#39;re just... out of money. No government backstop. You&#39;re trusting Circle&#39;s Treasury holdings or Tether&#39;s reserves with zero insurance guarantee.</p> <p>For everyday users, this is <em>huge</em> and barely discussed in policy conversations.</p> <h2 id=implications_for_on-chain_economy ><a href="#implications_for_on-chain_economy" class=header-anchor >Implications for On-Chain Economy</a></h2> <h3 id=asset_tokenization_the_real_revolution ><a href="#asset_tokenization_the_real_revolution" class=header-anchor >Asset Tokenization: The Real Revolution</a></h3> <p>The article touches on this but doesn&#39;t go deep enough. Here&#39;s what&#39;s coming:</p> <p><strong>Real Estate</strong>: Imagine owning 0.001&#37; of a Manhattan apartment building. Trade it like a stock. Get rent payments automatically via smart contract. No lawyers, no minimum investment, instant liquidity.</p> <p><strong>Stocks/Bonds</strong>: T&#43;0 settlement instead of T&#43;2. Trade stocks 24/7. Fractional ownership without brokerage fees. Your shares are actually <em>yours</em> in a wallet, not IOU&#39;s from a broker.</p> <p><strong>Commodities</strong>: Gold, oil, carbon credits—all tokenized. Trade them, use them as collateral, move them globally in seconds. The entire commodities market could move on-chain.</p> <p><strong>Art/Collectibles</strong>: Split a Picasso into 1 million tokens. Suddenly high-value assets have liquidity without selling the whole thing.</p> <p>The big deal: right now, these markets are siloed. With tokenization on open blockchains, you can use your tokenized real estate as collateral to borrow stablecoins to buy tokenized stocks, all in one transaction. Assets become truly composable.</p> <h3 id=crypto_from_speculative_to_structural ><a href="#crypto_from_speculative_to_structural" class=header-anchor >Crypto: From Speculative to Structural</a></h3> <p>Bitcoin and Ethereum were &quot;magic internet money&quot; for speculation. Post-GENIUS Act, crypto infrastructure becomes the <em>actual financial system</em>.</p> <p><strong>DeFi stops being a playground</strong>: When real dollars &#40;via stablecoins&#41; flow through DeFi protocols at scale, stuff like:</p> <ul> <li><p>Uniswap becomes a legitimate alternative to Nasdaq</p> <li><p>Aave/Compound compete with banks on lending &#40;oh wait, lending is still regulated—but they can dominate the custody/collateral layer&#41;</p> <li><p>Yield farming becomes actual treasury management</p> </ul> <p><strong>Crypto as career infrastructure</strong>: Right now, working in crypto is niche. Soon, it&#39;s just... finance. Smart contract auditors, on-chain analysts, DeFi product managers—these become standard jobs.</p> <p><strong>Regulatory clarity &#61; institutional flood</strong>: The biggest blocker for institutions wasn&#39;t technology—it was regulatory uncertainty. GENIUS Act removes that. Expect pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, corporations to suddenly have stablecoin treasury strategies.</p> <h2 id=day-to-day_life_implications ><a href="#day-to-day_life_implications" class=header-anchor >Day-to-Day Life Implications</a></h2> <p>Let me get practical. Here&#39;s what changes for you:</p> <h3 id=payments_transfers ><a href="#payments_transfers" class=header-anchor ><strong>Payments &amp; Transfers</strong></a></h3> <p><strong>Today</strong>: Venmo someone, Zelle, PayPal—still takes 1-3 days to settle, fees for instant transfers, can&#39;t send money internationally without huge fees/delays.</p> <p><strong>Tomorrow</strong>: Send stablecoins instantly, anywhere, 24/7. Your friend in Tokyo gets it in seconds, not days. No &#36;30 Western Union fees.</p> <p><strong>But also</strong>: Every payment is on a public ledger. Your employer sends your salary in USDC—now anyone can see your wallet balance if they find your address.</p> <h3 id=savings_checking ><a href="#savings_checking" class=header-anchor ><strong>Savings &amp; Checking</strong></a></h3> <p><strong>Today</strong>: Bank savings account pays 0.5&#37; APY &#40;if you&#39;re lucky&#41;. They lend your money at 8&#37;&#43; and keep the difference.</p> <p><strong>Tomorrow</strong>: &quot;Savings&quot; might mean holding stablecoins in a DeFi protocol earning 5-8&#37; APY, backed by transparent on-chain collateral instead of opaque bank lending.</p> <p><strong>But also</strong>: No FDIC insurance. If the smart contract has a bug or the protocol gets exploited, your savings are gone. You&#39;re your own bank—which means you&#39;re also your own risk manager.</p> <h3 id=buying_stuff ><a href="#buying_stuff" class=header-anchor ><strong>Buying Stuff</strong></a></h3> <p><strong>Today</strong>: Credit card, debit card, cash. Intermediaries everywhere taking 2-3&#37; fees &#40;that merchants pass to you via prices&#41;.</p> <p><strong>Tomorrow</strong>: Scan QR code, pay from your wallet in stablecoins, instant settlement, minimal fees. Merchants save 2-3&#37;, potentially pass some savings to you.</p> <p><strong>But also</strong>: Transaction finality is permanent. Fat-fingered an extra zero? Sent to the wrong address? No bank to call. It&#39;s just... gone.</p> <h3 id=borrowing_lending ><a href="#borrowing_lending" class=header-anchor ><strong>Borrowing &amp; Lending</strong></a></h3> <p><strong>Today</strong>: Want a loan? Fill out forms, wait for approval, credit check, 7-15&#37; interest rates.</p> <p><strong>Tomorrow</strong>: Still heavily regulated &#40;article correctly notes this&#41;. BUT—the collateral management layer moves on-chain. You might collateralize a loan with tokenized assets &#40;your tokenized stocks, real estate, etc.&#41; and get instant approval based on code, not a bank officer&#39;s decision.</p> <h3 id=your_jobbusiness ><a href="#your_jobbusiness" class=header-anchor ><strong>Your Job/Business</strong></a></h3> <p><strong>If you&#39;re employed</strong>: Companies might start paying salaries in stablecoins. Instant settlement, no waiting for direct deposit.

Get paid instantly by clients anywhere, no PayPal taking 3&#37;&#43; fees and holding your money for days.</p> <h2 id=the_uncomfortable_truths ><a href="#the_uncomfortable_truths" class=header-anchor >The Uncomfortable Truths</a></h2> <h3 id=winners ><a href="#winners" class=header-anchor ><strong>Winners</strong></a></h3> <ul> <li><p>Tech-savvy early adopters who learn the new system</p> <li><p>Stablecoin issuers &#40;Circle, maybe Tether, big banks that adapt&#41;</p> <li><p>Asset managers like BlackRock who manage the reserves</p> <li><p>DeFi protocols that become the new financial infrastructure</p> <li><p>Developers who can build financial products as code</p> </ul> <h3 id=losers ><a href="#losers" class=header-anchor ><strong>Losers</strong></a></h3> <ul> <li><p>Traditional regional banks &#40;extinct&#41;</p> <li><p>Anyone who doesn&#39;t adapt &#40;the &quot;unbanked&quot; could become the &quot;unchained&quot; or they could be left even further behind&#41;</p> <li><p>People who want financial privacy</p> <li><p>Anyone not tech-literate enough to manage their own keys/security</p> <li><p>Countries fighting dollar hegemony &#40;sorry, BRICS&#41;</p> </ul> <h3 id=the_skills_gap_nobodys_preparing_for_aka_massive_opportunity ><a href="#the_skills_gap_nobodys_preparing_for_aka_massive_opportunity" class=header-anchor ><strong>The Skills Gap Nobody&#39;s Preparing For &#40;AKA: Massive Opportunity&#41;</strong></a></h3> <p>The article celebrates &quot;permissionless innovation&quot; but here&#39;s the problem: most people can barely manage their bank password.</p> <p>Now we&#39;re expecting them to:</p> <ul> <li><p>Secure their own private keys &#40;lose them &#61; lose everything, no password reset&#41;</p> <li><p>Understand gas fees and network congestion</p> <li><p>Evaluate smart contract risk</p> <li><p>Manage their own transaction privacy</p> <li><p>Identify scams in a permissionless environment where there&#39;s no bank fraud department to call</p> </ul> <p>This is going to be <em>messy</em> for a decade before it gets smooth.</p> <p><strong>But wait—you&#39;re absolutely right. This is MASSIVE opportunity disguised as a problem.</strong></p> <p>Think about what happened when the internet went mainstream in the &#39;90s:</p> <ul> <li><p>&quot;Nobody knows how to use email&#33;&quot; → Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo became billion-dollar businesses</p> <li><p>&quot;People don&#39;t understand web security&#33;&quot; → Norton, McAfee, password managers exploded</p> <li><p>&quot;Building websites is too technical&#33;&quot; → Wordpress, Squarespace, Wix democratized web design</p> <li><p>&quot;E-commerce is confusing&#33;&quot; → Shopify, PayPal, Stripe built abstraction layers</p> </ul> <p><strong>The same playbook is about to run in crypto/stablecoin infrastructure:</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Wallet UX/Security Layer</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The problem</strong>: Self-custody is terrifying for normies</p> <li><p><strong>The opportunity</strong>: Build &quot;banks without being banks&quot;—custodial wallets with social recovery, biometric security, insurance products. Think Coinbase Wallet meets 1Password meets travel insurance.</p> <li><p><strong>Who wins</strong>: Companies that abstract away private key management while giving users control. Account abstraction &#40;ERC-4337&#41; makes wallets feel like normal apps.</p> </ul> <p><strong>2. Transaction Management Layer</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The problem</strong>: Gas fees, network congestion, choosing which chain to use</p> <li><p><strong>The opportunity</strong>: Aggregators that automatically route transactions through the cheapest/fastest path. You click &quot;send &#36;100 to Japan&quot;—the app figures out whether to use Solana, Arbitrum, or Base under the hood.</p> <li><p><strong>Who wins</strong>: The &quot;Kayak for blockchain transactions&quot; that optimizes cost/speed/security automatically.</p> </ul> <p><strong>3. Smart Contract Risk Assessment</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The problem</strong>: How do you know if a DeFi protocol is safe or a scam?</p> <li><p><strong>The opportunity</strong>: Credit ratings for smart contracts. Automated audit services. Insurance protocols. &quot;This contract has a CertiK AAA rating and &#36;10M insurance backing.&quot;</p> <li><p><strong>Who wins</strong>: The &quot;Moody&#39;s for DeFi&quot;—whoever builds trust infrastructure for code-based finance.</p> </ul> <p><strong>4. Privacy Management</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The problem</strong>: Everything&#39;s on a public ledger</p> <li><p><strong>The opportunity</strong>: Privacy-as-a-service tools. Mixers &#40;legal ones&#41;, zero-knowledge proof integrations, private transaction routing. Think &quot;incognito mode&quot; for blockchain.</p> <li><p><strong>Who wins</strong>: Whoever makes privacy accessible without requiring a PhD in cryptography.</p> </ul> <p><strong>5. Scam Protection &amp; Recovery</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The problem</strong>: No fraud department, no chargebacks</p> <li><p><strong>The opportunity</strong>: </p> <ul> <li><p>Real-time transaction screening &#40;&quot;This address has been flagged in 47 scams, block it?&quot;&#41;</p> <li><p>Social recovery protocols &#40;your trusted contacts can help recover lost keys&#41;</p> <li><p>Insurance pools for hacks/losses</p> <li><p>AI-powered scam detection</p> </ul> <li><p><strong>Who wins</strong>: The &quot;Norton Antivirus for Web3&quot;—real-time protection everyone installs by default.</p> </ul> <p><strong>6. Education &amp; Onboarding</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The problem</strong>: Crypto is intimidating</p> <li><p><strong>The opportunity</strong>: </p> <ul> <li><p>&quot;Crypto driving school&quot;—courses, certifications, hands-on training</p> <li><p>Gamified learning &#40;Duolingo for DeFi&#41;</p> <li><p>White-glove onboarding services for businesses</p> <li><p>Compliance-as-a-service for companies navigating regulations</p> </ul> <li><p><strong>Who wins</strong>: Whoever makes the learning curve less steep gets millions of users.</p> </ul> <p><strong>7. The &quot;Abstraction Layer&quot; Play</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The biggest opportunity</strong>: Build interfaces so good that people use stablecoins/crypto <em>without knowing they&#39;re using it</em>.</p> <li><p>Think Venmo, but it&#39;s actually USDC on Base under the hood. The user just sees &quot;send &#36;50 to Sarah&quot;—doesn&#39;t know or care about blockchains.</p> <li><p><strong>Who wins</strong>: The company that makes blockchain invisible. Just like you don&#39;t think about TCP/IP when you browse the web.</p> </ul> <p><strong>The Real Gold Rush</strong></p> <p>Every pain point you listed is a billion-dollar problem waiting for a solution:</p> <ul> <li><p>Can&#39;t manage private keys? → MPC wallets, social recovery, biometric custody</p> <li><p>Don&#39;t understand gas fees? → Fee abstraction, account abstraction &#40;ERC-4337&#41;</p> <li><p>Can&#39;t evaluate contracts? → Automated audits, insurance, risk ratings</p> <li><p>Worried about scams? → Real-time screening, recovery protocols</p> <li><p>Confused by complexity? → Education platforms, white-glove services</p> </ul> <p><strong>The Pattern</strong>: Every time technology makes a massive leap, there&#39;s a decade of &quot;UX hell&quot; where early adopters suffer through bad interfaces. Then a wave of companies builds the abstraction layer that makes it accessible to everyone.</p> <p>We&#39;re entering the &quot;UX hell&quot; phase right now. The companies that solve it will be the Googles, Amazons, and Apples of the blockchain era.</p> <p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: You&#39;re right—this isn&#39;t just a problem, it&#39;s the entrepreneurial opportunity of the decade. The people who solve the skills gap will capture enormous value because they&#39;ll be the bridge between &quot;too complicated for normal people&quot; and &quot;ubiquitous financial infrastructure.&quot;</p> <p>The question isn&#39;t whether someone will build these solutions. The question is: who&#39;s going to build them <em>first</em>?</p> <h3 id=the_geopolitical_wildcard ><a href="#the_geopolitical_wildcard" class=header-anchor ><strong>The Geopolitical Wildcard</strong></a></h3> <p>The article nails the Treasury demand angle, but misses that this makes the entire global economy <em>more</em> dependent on US policy.</p> <p>What happens when:</p> <ul> <li><p>The US decides to sanction a country and stablecoin issuers freeze wallets</p> <li><p>A geopolitical rival decides to fight back by launching competing digital currency infrastructure</p> <li><p>Ethereum &#40;or whatever chain dominates&#41; becomes a geopolitical target</p> </ul> <p>We&#39;re not just financializing code—we&#39;re making code a battlefield.</p> <h2 id=bottom_line ><a href="#bottom_line" class=header-anchor >Bottom Line</a></h2> <p>The GENIUS Act isn&#39;t just about banks vs. fintech or dollar dominance. It&#39;s the financialization of <em>everything</em>, moving from closed systems to open code, from trusted intermediaries to trustless protocols.</p> <p>That&#39;s exhilarating if you believe in open systems and innovation.</p> <p>That&#39;s terrifying if you think about all the ways code fails, all the people who&#39;ll get left behind, and all the new systemic risks we&#39;re creating.</p> <p>The article you linked is right that this is huge. But it&#39;s also messier, riskier, and more complicated than the &quot;banks lose, America wins&quot; narrative suggests.</p> <p>We&#39;re not just changing who holds your money. We&#39;re changing what money <em>is</em>, how it moves, who controls it, and what happens when things go wrong. That&#39;s not just a policy shift—it&#39;s a civilization-level upgrade with no rollback button.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The on-chain economy means everything becomes tokenized, tradeable, and programmable. Crypto goes from speculative to structural. Your daily life gets faster, cheaper, and more global—but also more complex, less private, and way more &quot;you&#39;re on your own if something breaks.&quot;</p> <p>The future is exciting. It&#39;s also going to be chaotic as hell.</p> <div class=page-foot > Contact me by <a href="mailto:skchu@wustl.edu">E-mail</a> | <a href="https://github.com/kchu25">Github</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kchu1/">Linkedin</a> <br> This work is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>.
